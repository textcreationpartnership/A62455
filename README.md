AN EPILOGUE TO THE TRAGEDY OF THE Church of England, BEING A Neceſſary Conſideration and brief Reſol
1. A PREFACE To all Chriſtian Readers.
THE CONTENTS OF THE Firſt Book.CHAP. I. ALL agree, that Reaſon is to decide controverſies of Faith. 
#####Body#####

1. OF THE PRINCIPLES OF Chriſtian Truth.

    _ The Firſt BOOK.

      * CHAP. I. All agree, that Reaſon is to decide controverſies of Faith. The objection, that Faith is taught by Gods Spirit, anſwered. What Reaſon decideth queſtions of Faith. The reſolution of Faith ends not in the light of Reaſon, but in that which Reaſon evidenceth to come from Gods meſſengers.

      * CHAP. II. The queſtion between the Scripture and the Church, which of them is Judge in matters of Faith. Whether opinion, the Tradition of the Church ſtands better with. Thoſe that hold the Scripture to be clear in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, have no reaſon to exclude the Tradition of the Church. What opinions they are, that deny the Church to be a Society or Corporation by Gods Law.

      * CHAP. III. That neither the ſentence of the Church, nor the dictate of Gods Spirit, can be the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be received. No man can know that hee hath Gods Spirit, without knowing that hee is a true Chriſtian; Which ſuppoſeth the truth of the Scripture. The motives of Faith are the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be believed: And the conſent of Gods people the reaſon that evidences thoſe motives to be infallibly true. How the Scriptures are believed for themſelves. How a Circle is made in rendering a reaſon of the Faith. The Scriptures are Gods Law to all, to whom they are publiſhed, by Gods act of publiſhing them; But Civil Law, by the act of Soveraign Powers, in acting Chriſtianity upon their Subjects.

      * CHAP. IV. Neither the Dictate of Gods Spirit nor the authority of the Church is the reaſon of believing any thing in Chriſtianity. Whether the Church be before the Scripture, or the Scripture before the Church. The Scriptures contain not the Infallibility of the Church. Nor the conſent of all Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. V. All things neceſſary to ſalvation are not clear in the Scriptures to all underſtandings. Not in the Old Teſtament. Not in the Goſpel. Not in the Writings of the Apoſtles. It is neceſſary to ſalvation to believe more than this, that our Lord is the Chriſt. Time cauſeth obſcurity in the Scriptures, aſwell as in other Records. That it is no where ſaid in the Scriptures, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are clear in the Scriptures. Neither is there any conſent of all Chriſtians to evidence the ſame.

      * CHAP. VI. All interpretation of Scripture is to be confined within the Tradition of the Church. This ſuppoſeth that the Church is a Communion inſtituted by God. What means there is to make evidence of Gods Charter, upon which the Corporation of the Church ſubſiſteth. The name of the Church, in the Scriptures, often ſignifieth the Whole or Cathelick Church.

      * CHAP. VII. That the Apoſtles delivered to the Church a Summary of Chriſtianity, which, all ſhould be baptized were to profeſs. Evidence out of the Scriptures. Evidence out of the Scriptures for Tradition regulating the Communion of the Church, and the Order of it. Evidence for the Rule of Faith, out of the records of the Church. For the Canons of the Church, and the pedegree of them from the Order eſtabliſhed in the Church by the Apoſtles. That the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and that by being baptized, is neceſſary to the ſalvation of a Chriſtian.

      * CHAP. VIII. That the Power of Governing the whole Church was in the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, and thoſe whom they took to aſſiſt them in the parts of it. The Power of their Succeſſors muſt needs be derived from thoſe. Why that Succeſſion which appeares in one Church, neceſſarily holdeth all Churches. The holding of Councils evidenceth the Ʋnity of the Church.

      * CHAP. IX. The Keyes of the Church given the Apoſtles, and exerciſed by Excommunication under the Apoſtles. The ground thereof is that profeſſion, which, all that are baptized are to make. That Penance and abatemeut of Penance hath been in force ever ſince and under the Apoſtles. In particular, of excluding Hereticks.

      * CHAP. X. Evidence of the Apoſtles act from the effect of it, in preſerving the Ʋnity of the Church. Of the buſineſſe of Marcion and Montanus. That about keeping Eaſter. That of the Novations, of rebaptizing Hereticks, of Paulus Samoſatenus, of Dionyſius Alexandrinus, and Arius. Of communicatory leters, and the intercourſe of the Church under and after the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. XI.Ʋpon what grounds the firſt book de Synedriis holds that the Church cannot excommunicate. Before the Law there was no ſuch Power, nor by it. Chriſtians went for Jewes under the Apoſtles. His ſenſe of ſome Scriptures. What the Leviatha• ſaith in general concerning the Power of the Church. Both ſuppoſe that Eccleſiaſtical Power includeth Temporal, which is not true. Of the Oxford Doctors Paraeneſis.

      * CHAP. XII. That the Law experſly covenanted for the Land of Promiſe. A great Objection againſt this, from the Great precept of the Law. The hope of the world to come under the Law, and the obedience which it requireth, was grounded upon reaſon from the true God, the Tradition of the Fathers, and the Doctrine of the Prophets. The Love of God above all by the Law extendeth no further than the precepts of the Law, the love of our Neighbor onely to Jewes. Of the Ceremonial, Judicial and Moral Law.

      * CHAP. XIII. That the Law tendreth no other promiſe but that of the Land of Canaan. How the Reſurrection is ſignified by the Prophets. Expreſſe texts of the Apoſtles. Their arguments, and the arguments of our Lord do ſuppoſe the myſtical ſenſe of the Scriptures. That this ſenſe is to be made good throughout the Scripture, whereſoever the ground of it takes place; Chriſtianity well grounded ſuppoſing this. What parts of Scripture may be queſtionable, whether they have a myſtical ſenſe or not. The ſayings and doings of our Lord have it; As alſo thoſe paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which are fulfilled by the ſame. The ſenſe of the Fathers.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Leviathans opin•on, that Chriſt came to reſtore that kingdome of God which the Jewes caſt off when they rejected Samuel. It overthroweth the foundation of Chriſtianity. The true Government of Gods ancient people. The name of the Church in the New Teſtament cannot ſignifie the Synagogue. Nor any Chriſtian State.

      * CHAP. XV. How the Power of the Church is founded upon the Law. The Power of the Kingdome, Prieſthood, Prophets, and Rulers of that people all of divine right. How farre theſe qualities and the powers of them are to continue in the Church. The ſenſe of the Fathers in this point. That the acts of S. Paul and the reſt of the Apoſtles were not of force by virtue of the Law. What Eccleſiaſtical Power ſhould have been among the Jewes, in caſe they had received the Goſpel, and ſo the State had ſtood.

      * CHAP. XVI. The Church founded upon the Power given the Apoſtles. What is the ſubject mater of Church Lawes. The right of the Church to Tithes and Oblations is not grounded upon the Law, though evidenced by it, and by practice of the Patriarchs. Evidence of the Apoſtles Order in the Scriptures. The Church of Jeruſalem held not community of Goods. The original practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power of Excommunication in the Church is not founded in the Law. What argument there is of it in the Old Teſtament. The allegorical ſenſe thereof is argumentative. It was not neceſſary that the Chriſtians ſhould incurre perſecution for uſing the Power of the Keyes, and not by virtue of the Law.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The difference between S. Pauls anathema and that of the Jewes. It is not neceſſary that the Chriſtians anathema ſhould ſignifie curſing. That the inceſtuous perſon at Corinth was Excommunicated by S. Paul. Juriſdiction of the Church. Telling the Church, binding and looſing, holding him that is bound for a Heathen or a Publicane, ſigniſie the ſame. The coherence of our Lords diſcourſe. Of Excommunication and Indulgence by private perſons in the Ancient Church. That Excommunication and the Power of the Church could not come in force by the voluntary conſent of the firſt Chriſtians. How it may be ſaid to be voluntary. Of the confederacy of the primitive Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XIX. That Power which was in Churches under the Apoſtles, can never be in any Chriſtian Soveraign. The difference between the Church and the Synagogue in that regard. The intereſt of Secular Power in determining maters of Faith preſuppoſeth the Society of the Church, and the act of it. No man can be bound to profeſſe the contrary of that which hee believeth. Every man is bound to profeſſe that Chriſtianity which hee believeth. The Church is the chief Teacher of Chriſtianity through Chriſtendom, as the Soveraign of Civil Peace, thorough his Dominions. Why the Church is to decide maters of Faith rather than the State, neither being infallible.

      * CHAP. XX. The reſt of the Oxford Doctors pretenſe. The Power of binding and looſing ſuppoſeth not onely the Preaching of the Goſpel, but the outward act of Faith. Chriſtians are not at liberty to caſt themſelves into what formes of Churches the Law of Nature alloweth. They are Judges in chief for themſelves in mater of Religion, ſuppoſing the Catholick Church; not otherwiſe. Secular Power cannot puniſh for Religion, but ſuppoſing the act of the Church, nor do any act to inforce Religion, unleſſe the Church determine the mater of it.

      * CHAP. XXI. How the Tradition of the Church limits the interpretation of Scriptures. How the declaration of the Church becomes a reaſonable mark of Hereſie. That which is not found in the Scriptures may have been delivered by the Apoſtles. Some things delivered by the Apoſtles, and recorded in the Scriptures; may not oblige. S. Auſtines Rule of Apoſtolical Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Authority of the Fathers is not grounded upon any preſumption of their Learning or Holineſſe. How farr they challenge the credit of Hiſtorical truth. The pre-eminenee of the Primitive. The preſumption that is grounded upon their ranks and qualities in the Church. Of Arnobius, Lactantius, Tertullian, Origen, Clemens, and the approbation of poſterity.

      * CHAP. XXIII. Two inſtances againſt the premiſes, beſides the objection concerning the beginning of Antichriſt under the Apoſtles. The general anſwer to it. The ſeven Trumpets in the Apocalypſe fore-tell the deſtruction of the Jewes. The ſeven Vials, the plagues inflicted upon the Empire for the ten perſecutions. The correſpondence of Deniels Propheſie inferreth the ſame. Neither S. Pauls Prophe••e nor S. Johns concerneth any Chriſtian. Neither the opinion of the Chiliaſts, nor the giving of the Euchariſt to Infants new Baptized, Catholick.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Two ſorts of means to reſolve whatſoever is reſolvable concerning the Scripture. Upon what terms the Church may, or is to determine controverſies of Faith. And what obligation that determination produceth. Traditions of the Apoſtles oblige the preſent Church, as the reaſons of them continue or not. Inſtances in our Lords Paſſeover and Euchariſt. Penance under the Apoſtles, and afterwards. S. Pauls vail, eating blood, and things offered to Idols. The power of the Church in limiting theſe Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXV. The power of the Church in limiting even the Traditions of the Apoſtles. Not every abuſe of this power, a ſufficient warrant for particular Churches to reforme themſelves. Hereſie conſiſts in denying ſomething, neceſſary to ſalvation to be believed. Schiſm, in departing from the unity of the Church, whether upon that, or any other cauſe. Implicite Faith no virtue; but the effect of it may be the work of Chriſtian charity.

      * CHAP. XXVI. What it is to adde to Gods Law; What to adde the Apocalypſe. S. Pauls Anathema. The Beraeans. S. Johns Goſpel ſufficient to make one believe; and the Scriptures, The man of God perfit. How the Law giveth light, and Chriſtians are taught by God. How Idolatry is ſaid, not to be commanded by God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. Why it was death to tranſgreſs the determinations of the Jews Conſiſtory, and what power this argueth in the Church. A difference between the authority of the Apoſtles, and that of the Church. The being of the Church to the worlds end, with power of the Keyes, makes it not infallible. Obedience to Superiors, and the Pillar of truth inferre it not.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The Fathers acknowledge the Sufficience and clearneſs of the Scriptures, as, the Traditions of the Church. They are to be reconciled, by limiting the terms which they uſe. The limitation of thoſe ſayings which make all Chriſtian truth to be contained in the Scriptures. Of thoſe which make the authority of the Church the ground of Faith.

      * CHAP. XXXII. Anſwer to an Objection, that choice of Religion becomes difficult upon theſe terms. This reſolution is for the Intereſt of the Reformation. Thoſe that make the Church Infallible cannot, thoſe that make the Scripture clear and ſufficient may own Tradition for evidence to determine the meaning of the Scriptures, and Controverſies of Faith. The Intereſt of the Church of England. The pretenſe of Ruſhworthes Dialogues, that wee have no unqueſtionable Scripture, and, that the Tradition of the Church never changes.

      * CHAP. XXXI. That the Scriptures which wee have are unqueſtionable. That miſtakes in Copying are not conſiderable to the ſenſe and effect of them. The meaning of the Hebrew and Greek, even of the Prophets, determinable, to the deciding of Controverſies. How Religion delivered by Tradition becomes ſubject to be corrupted.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. The Diſpute concerning the Canon of Scripture, and the tranſlations thereof, in two Queſtions. There can be no Tradition for thoſe books that were written ſince Propheſie ceaſed. Wherein the excellence of them above other books lies. The chief objections againſt them are queſtionable. In thoſe parcels of the New Teſtament that have been queſtioned, the caſe is not the ſame. The ſenſe of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Onely the Original Copy can be Authentick. But, the truth thereof may as well be found in the tranſlations of the Old Teſtament, as in the Jewes Copies. The Jewes have not falſified them of malice. The Points come neither from Moſes, nor Eſdras, but from the Talmud Jewes.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. Of the anci•n eſt Tranſlations of the Bible into Greek firſt; With the Authors and authority of the ſame; Then into the Chaldee, Syriack, and Latine. Exceptions againſt the Greek, and the Samaritane Pentateuch. They are helps nevertheleſs to aſſure the true reading of the Scriptures, though with other Copies; whether Jewiſh or Chriſtian. Though the Vulgar Latine were better than the preſent Greek, yet muſt both depend upon the Original Greek of the New Teſta•ent. No danger to Chriſtianity by the differences remaining in the Bible.

      * CHAP. 1. Two parts of that which remains. How the diſpute concerning the Holy Trinity with Socinus belongs to the firſt. The Queſtion of juſtification by Faith alone. The Opinion of Socinus concerning the whole Covenant of Grace. The opinion of thoſe who make juſtifying Faith the knowledge of a mans Predeſtination, oppoſite to it in the other extream. The difference between it and that of the Antinomians. That there are mean Opinions.

      * CHAP. II. Evidence what is the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. The contract of Baptiſm. The promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt annexed to Chriſts, not to Johns Baptiſm. Thoſe are made Chriſts Diſciples as Chriſtians that take up his Croſſe in Baptiſm. The effects of Baptiſm according to the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. III. The exhortations of the Apoſtles, that are drawn from the patterns of the Old Teſtament, ſuppoſe the ſame. How the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament are the ſame, how not the ſame. How the New Teſtament and the New Covenant are both one. The free-will of man acteth the ſame part in dealing about the New-Covenant, as about the Old. The Gospel a Law.

      * CHAP. IV. The conſent of the whole Church evidenced by the cuſtome of chatechiſing. By the opinion thereof concerning the ſalvation of thoſe that delayed their Baptiſm. By the rites and Ceremonies of Baptiſm. Why no penance for ſins before, but after Baptiſm. The doctrine of the Church of England evident in this caſe.

      * CHAP. V. The Preaching of our Lord and his Apoſtles evidenceth, that ſome act of Mans free choice is the condition which it requireth. The correspondence betwen the Old and New Teſtament inferreth the ſame. So do the errors of Socinians and Antinomians concerning the neceſſity of Baptiſm. Objections deferred.

      * CHAP. VI. Juſtifying Faith ſometimes conſiſts in believing the truth. Sometimes, in truſt in God grounded upon the truth. Somtimes in Chriſtianity, that is in imbracing and profeſſing it. And that in the Fathers as well as in the Scriptures. Of the informed and formed Faith of the Schools.

      * CHAP. VII. The laſt ſignification of Faith is properly justifying Faith. The firſt by a Metonymy of the cauſe: The ſecond of the effect. Thoſe that are not juſtified doe truly believe. The truſt of a Chriſtian preſuppoſeth him to be juſtified. All the promiſes of the Goſpel become due at once by the Covenant of Grace. That, to believe that we are Elect or Juſtified, is not Justifying Faith.

      * CHAP. VIII. The objection from S. Paul; We are not juſtified by the Law nor by Workes, but by Grace and by Faith. Not meant of the Goſpel, and the workes that ſuppoſe it. The queſtion that S. Paul ſpeakes to, is of the Law of Moſes and the Workes of it. He ſets thoſe workes in the ſame rank with the workes of the Gentils by the light of nature. The civil and outward workes of the Law may be done by Gentiles. How the Law is a Pedagogue to Chriſt.

      * CHAP. IX. Of the Faith and Juſtification of Abraham and the Patriarkes, according to the Apoſtles. Of the Prophets and righteous men under the Law. Abraham and Rahab the harlot juſtified by workes, if juſtified by Faith. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend upon works which the Goſpell injoyneth. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. X. What Pelagius queſtioneth concerning the Grace of Chriſt, what Socinus further of the ſtate of Chriſt before his birth. The oppoſition between the firſt and ſecond Adam in S. Paul, evidenceth originall ſinne. Coucupiſcence in the unregenerate, and the inability of the Law to ſubdue it, evict the ſame. The ſecond birth by the holy Ghoſt evidenceth that the first birth propagateth ſinne.

      * CHAP. X. The Old Teſtament chargeth all men as well as the wicked to be ſinfull from the wombe. David complaineth of himſelfe as born in ſinne, no leſſe then the Wiſe man of the children of the Gentiles. How Leviticall Lawes argue the ſame. And temporall death under the Old Teſtament. The book of Wiſdome and the Greek Bible.

      * CHAP. XII. The Haereſie of Simon Magus the beginning of the Gnoſticks. That they were in being during the Apoſtles time. Where and when the Haereſie of Cerinthus prevailed, and, that they were Gnoſticks. The beginning of the Encratites under the Apostles. It is evident that one God in Trinity was then glorified among the Christians, by the Fullneſſe of the Godhead which they introduced in ſtead of it.

      * CHAP. XIII. The Word was at the beginning of all things. The apparitions of the Old Teſtament Prefaces to the Incarnation of Chriſt. Ambaſſadors are not honoured with the honour due to their Maſters. The Word of God that was afterwards incarnate was in thoſe Angels that ſpoke in Gods Name. No Angel honoured as God under the New Teſtament. The Word was with God at the beginning of all things, as after his return.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Name of God not aſcribed to Chriſt for the like reaſon as to creatures. The reaſons why the Socinians worſhip Chriſt as God do confute their limitations. Chriſt not God by virtue of his riſing againe. He is the Great God with S. Paul, the true God, with S. John, the onely Lord, with S. Jude. Other Scriptures. Of the forme of God, and of a ſervant in S. Paul.

      * CHAP. XV. Not onely the Church but the World was made by Chriſt. The Word was made fleſh in oppoſition to the Spirit. How the Prophets, how Chriſtians, by receiving the Word of God, are poſſeſſed by his Spirit. How the title of Sonne of God importeth the Godhead. How Chriſt is the brightneſſe and Image of God.

      * CHAP. XVI. The teſtimonies of Chriſts Godhead in the Old Teſtament are firſt underſtood of the figures of Chriſt. Of the Wiſdome of God in Solomon and elſewhere. Of the writings of the Jewes as well before as after Chriſt.

      * CHAP. XVII. Anſwer to thoſe texts of Scripture that ſeem to abate the true Godhead in Chriſt. Of that creature whereof Chriſt is the firſt-borne, and that which the Wiſdome of God made. That this beliefe is the originall Tradition of the Church. What meanes this diſpute furniſheth us with againſt the Arrians. That it is reaſon to ſubmit to revelation concerning the nature of God. The uſe of reaſon is no way renounced by holding this Faith.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The neceſſity of the grace of Chriſt, is the evidence of originall ſinne. How the exaltation of our Lord depends upon his humiliation, and the grace of Christ upon that▪ All the work of Chriſtianity is aſcribed to the grace of Chriſt. Gods predeſtination manifeſteth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XIX. Evidences of the ſame in the Old Teſtament; Of Gods help in getting the Land of Promiſe, and renewing the Covenant: And that for Chriſts ſake. That Chriſtianity cannot ſtand without acknowledging the grace of Chriſt. The Tradition of the Church; In the Baptiſme of Infants: In the Prayers of the Church; In the decrees against Pelagius and other records of the Church.

      * CHAP. XX. Wherein Originall ſinne conſiſteth; What opinions are on foot. That it is not Adams ſinne imputed to his poſterity. Whether man were at the firſt created to a ſupernaturall end, or not. An eſtate of meer nature, but innocent, poſſible. Originall ſinne is Concupiſcence. How Baptiſme voids it. Concerning the late novelty in the Church of England about Originall ſinne.

      * CHAP. XXI. The opinion that mak•s the Predetermination of mans will by God the ſourſe of his freedom; And wherein Janſenius differs from it. Of neceſsity upon ſuppoſition & abſolute. The neceſsity of the Will following the last dictate of the underſtanding is onely upon ſuppoſition, As alſo that which Gods foreſight creates. The difference between indifferent and undetermined.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Goſpel findeth man free from neceſſity, though not from bondage. Of the Antecedent and Conſequent Will of God. Praedetermination not the root, but the rooting up of Freedome and of Chriſtianity. Againſt the opinion of Janſenius.

      * CHAP. XXIII. A man is able to doe things truely honeſt under Originall ſin. But not to make God the end of all his doings. How all the actions of the Gentiles are ſins. They are accountable onely for the Law of nature. How all men have or have not Grace ſufficient to ſave.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Though God determineth not the will immediately, yet he determineth the effect thereof by the meanes of his providence, preſenting the object ſo as he foreſees it will chuſe, The caſes of Pharoah, of Solomon, of Ahab, and of the Jewes that crucified Chriſt. Of Gods foreknowledg of future conditionalls that come not to paſſe. The ground of foreknowledg of future contingencies. Difficult objections anſwered.

      * CHAP. XXV. The grounds of the difference between ſufficient and effectuall. How naturall occaſions, conduce to ſupernaturall actions, The inſufficience of Janſenius his doctrine. Of ſufficient grace under the Law of Moſes and Nature.

      * CHAP. XXVI. Predeſtination to grace abſolute, to glory reſpective: Purpoſe of denying effectuall Grace abſolute, of puniſhing reſpective. The end, to which God predeſtinates, is not the end for which he predeſtinates. Grace the reward of the right uſe of Grace. How much of the queſtion the Goſpell determines not. That our indeavours are ingaged no leſſe, then if predeſtination were not, it determineth. Of the Tradition of the Church; and of Semipelagians, Predeſtinatians and Arminians.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The queſtion concerning the ſatisfaction of Chriſt with Socinus. The reaſon why Sacrifices are figures of Chriſt, common to all ſacrifices. Why, and what Sacrifices the Fathers had, what the Law added. Of our ranſom by the price of Chriſts propitiatory Sacrifice.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Chriſt took away our ſinne by bearing the puniſhment of it. The Propheſie of Eſay LIII. We are reconciled to God by the Goſpel, in conſideration of Chriſts obedience. The reconcilement of Jews and Gentiles, Men and Angels, conſequent to the ſame. Of purging and expiating ſinne by Chriſt, and making propitiation for it. Of Chriſts dying for us.

      * CHAP. XXIX. The grant of Grace, in conſideration of Chriſt, ſuppoſes ſatisfaction made by him for ſinne. Neither our ſinnes imputable to Chriſt, nor his ſufferings to us, formally and perſonally, but, as the meritorious cauſes which ſatisfaction anſwereth. The effect of it, the Covenant of Grace, as well as help to performe it. The Fathers ſaved by the Faith of Chriſt to come. The Goſpel a new Law. The property of Satisfaction and Puniſhment in Chriſts ſufferings. Of the ſenſe of the Catholike Church.

      * CHAP. XXX. God might have reconciled man to himſelf without the coming of Chriſt. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend as well upon his active as paſſive obedience. Chriſt need not ſuffer •ell pa•nes that we might not. The opinion that maketh juſtifying Faith to be truſt in God not true; Yet not prejudiciall to the Faith. The decree of the Council of Trent, and the doctrine of the Schoole; how it is not prejudiciall to the Faith. As alſo that of Socinus.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ſtate of the queſtion concerning the perſeverance of thoſe that are once juſtified. Of three ſenſes, one true, one inconſiſtent with the Faith, the third neither true nor yet deſtructive to the Faith. Evidence from the writings of the Apoſtles. From the Old Teſtament. The grace of Propheſie when it preſuppoſeth ſanctifying grace. Anſwer to ſome Texts, and of S. Pauls meaning in the VII. of the Romans. Of the Polygamy of the Fathers. What aſſurance of Grace Chriſtians may have. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How the fullfilling of Gods Law is poſſible, how impoſſible▪ for a Chriſtian. Of the difference between mortall and v•niall ſinne. What love of God and of our neighbour was neceſſary under the Old Teſtament. Whether the S•rmon in the Mount correct the falſe interpretation of the Jewes, or inhanſe the obligation of the Law. Of the difference between matter of Precept and matter of Counſail; and the Perfection of Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Whether any workes of Chriſtians be ſatisfactory for ſinne, and meritorious of heaven, or not. The recovery of Gods grace for a Chriſtian fallen from it, a work of labour and time. The neceſſity and efficacy of Penance to that purpoſe, according to the Scriptures, and the practiſe of the Church. Merit by virtue of Gods promiſe, neceſſary. The Catholicke Church agrees in it, the preſent Church of Rome allowes merit of juſtice▪

      * CHAP. I. The Society of the Church founded upon the duty of communicating in the Offices of Gods Service. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt, among thoſe Offices, proper to Chriſtianity. What opinions, concerning the preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood in the Euchariſt, are on foot.

      * CHAP. II. That the natural ſubſtance of the Elements remains in the Sacrament. That the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is nevertheleſſe preſent in the ſame, when it is received, not by the receiving of it. The eating of the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe neceſſarily requireth the ſame. This cauſes no contradiction nor improperty in the words of our Lord.

      * CHAP. III. That the preſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt depends not upon the living Faith of him that receives, but upon the true profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the Church that celebrates. The Scriptures that are alleged for the dependence of it upon the communication of the properties. They conclude not the ſenſe of them by whom they are alleged. How the Scripture confineth the fleſh of Chriſt to the Heavens.

      * CHAP. IV. The opinion which maketh the Conſecration to be done by rehearſing the operative words. That our Lord conſecrated by Thanksgiving. The Form of it in all Liturgies, together with the conſent of the Fathers. Evidence, that there is no Tradition of the Church for the aboliſhing of the Elements.

      * CHAP. V. It cannot be proved by the Old Teſtament that the Euchariſt is a Sacrifice. How, by the New Teſtament it may be ſo accounted. Four reaſons thereof, depending upon the nature of Juſtifying Faith premiſed. The conſent of the Catholick Church. The concurrence of the Church of England to the premiſes.

      * CHAP. VI. The reaſon of the Order by which I proceed, brings me to the Baptiſm of Infants in the next place. The power of the Keyes ſeen in granting Baptiſm, as well as in communicating the Euchariſt. Why Socinians make Baptiſm indifferent: Why Antinomians make it a miſtake to Baptize. The grounds upon which I ſhake off both: With anſwer to ſome objections.

      * CHAP. VII. The ground of baptizing Infants Originall ſinne, though not inſtituted till Chriſt roſe again. No other cure for it. Infants of Chriſtians may be Diſciples, are holy. The effect of Circumciſion under the Law, inferreth the effect of Baptiſm under the Goſpel.

      * CHAP. VIII. What is alleadged to impeach Tradition for baptizing Infants; Proves not, that any could be ſaved regularly, who dyed unbaptized; but, that, baptizing at yeares was a ſtrong means to make good Chriſtians. Why the Church now Baptize, Infants. What becomes of Infants dying unbaptized, unanſwerable. What thoſe Infants g•t who dye baptized.

      * CHAP. IX. What controverſie the Reformation hath with the Church of Rome about Penance. Inward repentance that is ſincere, obtaineth pardon alone. Remiſſion of ſinnes by the Goſpel onely: The condition of it by the Miniſtrey of the Church. What the power of binding and looſing contains more then Preaching, or taking away offenſes. Sinne may be pardoned without the uſe of it. Wherein the neceſſity of uſing it lyeth.

      * CHAP. X. The Sects of the Montaniſts, Novations, Donatiſts, and Meletians, evidence the cure of ſinne by Penance, to be a Tradition of the Apoſtles. So doth the agreement of primitive practice with their writings. Indulgence of regular Penance from the Apoſtles. Confeſſion of ſecret ſinnes in the Primitive Church. That no ſinne can be cured without the Keyes of the Church, there is no Tradition from the Apoſtles. The neceſſity of confeſſing ſecret ſinnes, whereupon it ſtands.

      * CHAP. IX. Penance is not required to redeem tho debt of temporall puniſhment when the ſinne is pardoned. What aſſurance of forgiveneſſe, the law of auricular Confeſſion, as it is uſed in the Church of Rome, procureth Of injoyning Penance, after abſolution performed. Setting aſide abuſes, the Law is agreeable to Gods. Of the order taken by the Church of England.

      * CHAP. XI. The Unction of the ſick pretendeth onely bodily health, upon ſuppoſition of the cure of ſinne by the Keyes of the Church. Objections anſwered. The Tradition of the Church evidenceth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XII. The ground of the Right of the Church in Matrimonial cauſes. Mariage of one with one inſolubly is a Law of Chriſtianity; The Law of Moſes not injoyning it. The Law of the Empire not aiming at the ground of it. Evidence from the primitive practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XIV. Scripture alleged to prove the bond of Mariage inſoluble in caſe of adultery, uneffectuall. S. Paul and our Lord ſpeak both to one purpoſe, according to S. Jerome, and S. Auſtine. The contrary opinion more reaſonable, and more general in the Church. Why the Church may reſtrain the innocent party from marying again. The Imperial Lawes could never be of force to void the Power of the Church. Evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIV. Another opinion, admitting the ground of lawfull Impediments. What Impediments ariſe upon the Conſtitution of the Church, generally as a Society, or particularly, as of Chriſtians. By what Law ſome degrees are prohibited Chriſtians. And, of the Polygamy of the Patriarchs. Mariage with the deceaſed wives Siſter, and with a Couſin Germane, by what Law prohibited.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power given the XII. under the Title of Apoſtles, and the LXX. Diſciples. That the VII were Deacons. Of the firſt Presbyters at Jeruſalem, and the Intereſt of the People. Presbyters appropriated to Churches, under the Apoſtles. S. Pauls Deacons no Presbyters. No ground for Lay Flders.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The Apoſtles all of oequall power; S. Peter onely chiefe in managing it. The ground for the pre-•minence of Churches, before and over Churches. Of Alexandria, Antiochia, Jeruſalem and Rome. Ground for the pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, before all Churches. The conſequence of that Ground. A ſummary of the evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIX. Of the proceedings about Marcion and Montanus at Rome. The buſineſse of Pope Victor about keeping Eaſter; a peremptory inſtance. The buſineſſe of the Novatians evidenceth the ſame. Of the buſineſſes concerning the rebaptizing of Hereticks, Dionyſius of Alexandria, Paulus Samoſatenus, S. Cypriane, and, of the Donatiſts under Conſtantine.

      * CHAP. XX. Of the conſtitution and authority of Councils. The ground of the pre-eminences of Churches in the Romane Empire. The VI. Canon of the Council of Nicaea. The pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, and that of Conſtantinople. Some inſtances againſt the ſuperiority of Biſhops, out of the records of the Church; what offices every Order by Gods Law, or by Canon Law, miniſtreth.

      * CHAP. XXI. Of the times of God ſervice; By what Title of his Law the firſt day of the week is kept Holy. How the Sabbath is to be ſanctified by Moſes Law.

Of the difference of meats, and meaſure of Faſting. Of the keeping o four Lords Birthday, and other Feſtivals, and the regular hours of the day for Gods ſervice.

      * CHAP. XXII. The people of God •ied to build Synagogues, though not by the leter of the Law. The Church to provide Churches, though the Scripture command it not. Preſcribing the form of Gods publick ſervice, is not quenching the Spirit. The Pſalter is preſcribed the Church for Gods Praiſes. The Scriptures preſcribed to be read in the Church; The Order of reading them to be preſcribed by the Church.

      * CHAP. XXIII. The conſideration of the Euchariſt preſcribed by Tradition, for the mater of it. Lords Prayer preſcribed in all ſervices. The mater of Prayers for all eſtates preſcribed. The form of Baptiſm neceſſary to be preſcribed. The ſame reaſon holdeth in the forms of other Offices.

      * CHAP. XXIV. The Service of God to be preſcribed in a known Language. No pretenſe that the Latine is now underſtood. The means to preſerve Unity in the Church, notwithſtanding.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Prayer the more principall Office of Gods ſervice then Preaching. Preachings, neither Gods word, nor the meanes of ſalvation, unleſſe limited to the Faith of Gods Church.

Objections out of the ſcripture that it is the worſhip of a true God under an Image. the Originall of worſhipping the elements of the world: The Devil: And Images. Of the Idolatry of the Magicians, and of the Gnosticks. What Idolatry the caſes of Aron and of Jer•boam involve. Of the Idolatries practiſed under the Kings and Judges, in anſwer to objections.

      * CHAP. XXVI. The Place, or rather the State of happy and miſerable Soules otherwiſe underſtood by Gods people before Chriſts aſcenſion, then after it. What the Apocalypſe, what the reſt of the Apoſtles declare. Onely Martyrs before Gods Throne. Of the ſight of God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The Soules of the Fathers were not in the Devils Power till Chriſt; Though the Old Teſtament declare not their eſtate. Of Samuels ſoul. The ſoul of our Lord Chriſt, parting from his body, went with the Thiefe to Paradiſe. Of his triumph over the powers of darkneſſe. Prayer for the dead ſignifieth no delivering of ſoules out of Purgatory. The Covenant of Grace requires imperfect happineſſe before the generall judgement. Of forgiveneſſe in the world to come, and, paying the utmoſt farthing.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Ancient opinions in the Church, of the place of ſoules before the day of judgement. No Tradition that the Fathers were in the Ʋerge of Hell, under the Earth. The reaſon of the difference in the expreſſions of the Fathers of the Church. What Tradition of the Church for the place of Christs ſoule, during his death, The Saints ſoules in ſecret manſions, according to the Tradition of the Church. Prayer for the dead ſuppoſeth the ſame.

Three ſorts of prayers to Saints: The firſt, agreeable with Chriſtianity: The laſt may be Idolatry: The ſecond a ſtep to it. Of the Reliques of the Saints Bodies. What the ſecond Commandement prohibiteth or alloweth. The ſecond Councile of Nicea doth not decree Idolatry; And yet there is no decree in the Church for the worſhiping of Images.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ground for a Monaſticall life in the Scriptures; And in the practice of the primitive Church. The Church getteth no peculiar intereſt in them who profeſſe it, by their profeſſing of it. The nature and intent of it renders it ſubordinate to the Clergy. How farre the ſingle life of the Clergy hath been a Law to the Church. Inexecution of the Canons for it. Nullity of the proceeddings of the Church of Rome in it. The intereſt of the People in the acts of the Church; And in the uſe of the Scriptures.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How great the Power of the Church, and the effect of it is. The right of judging the cauſes of Chriſtians c•aſeth, when it is protected by the State. An Objection; If Eccl•ſiaſticall Power were from God, Secular Power could not limit the uſe of it. Ground for the Intereſt of the State in Church matters. The inconſequence of the argument. The concurrence of both Intereſts to the Law of the Church. The Intereſt of the State in the indowment of the Church. Concurrence of both in matrimoniall cauſes, and Ordinations.

The infinite Power of the Pope not founded upon acts of Epiſcopacy, but upon the Secular Powers of Chriſtendome.

    _ The ſecond BOOK.

      * CHAP. I. All agree, that Reaſon is to decide controverſies of Faith. The objection, that Faith is taught by Gods Spirit, anſwered. What Reaſon decideth queſtions of Faith. The reſolution of Faith ends not in the light of Reaſon, but in that which Reaſon evidenceth to come from Gods meſſengers.

      * CHAP. II. The queſtion between the Scripture and the Church, which of them is Judge in matters of Faith. Whether opinion, the Tradition of the Church ſtands better with. Thoſe that hold the Scripture to be clear in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, have no reaſon to exclude the Tradition of the Church. What opinions they are, that deny the Church to be a Society or Corporation by Gods Law.

      * CHAP. III. That neither the ſentence of the Church, nor the dictate of Gods Spirit, can be the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be received. No man can know that hee hath Gods Spirit, without knowing that hee is a true Chriſtian; Which ſuppoſeth the truth of the Scripture. The motives of Faith are the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be believed: And the conſent of Gods people the reaſon that evidences thoſe motives to be infallibly true. How the Scriptures are believed for themſelves. How a Circle is made in rendering a reaſon of the Faith. The Scriptures are Gods Law to all, to whom they are publiſhed, by Gods act of publiſhing them; But Civil Law, by the act of Soveraign Powers, in acting Chriſtianity upon their Subjects.

      * CHAP. IV. Neither the Dictate of Gods Spirit nor the authority of the Church is the reaſon of believing any thing in Chriſtianity. Whether the Church be before the Scripture, or the Scripture before the Church. The Scriptures contain not the Infallibility of the Church. Nor the conſent of all Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. V. All things neceſſary to ſalvation are not clear in the Scriptures to all underſtandings. Not in the Old Teſtament. Not in the Goſpel. Not in the Writings of the Apoſtles. It is neceſſary to ſalvation to believe more than this, that our Lord is the Chriſt. Time cauſeth obſcurity in the Scriptures, aſwell as in other Records. That it is no where ſaid in the Scriptures, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are clear in the Scriptures. Neither is there any conſent of all Chriſtians to evidence the ſame.

      * CHAP. VI. All interpretation of Scripture is to be confined within the Tradition of the Church. This ſuppoſeth that the Church is a Communion inſtituted by God. What means there is to make evidence of Gods Charter, upon which the Corporation of the Church ſubſiſteth. The name of the Church, in the Scriptures, often ſignifieth the Whole or Cathelick Church.

      * CHAP. VII. That the Apoſtles delivered to the Church a Summary of Chriſtianity, which, all ſhould be baptized were to profeſs. Evidence out of the Scriptures. Evidence out of the Scriptures for Tradition regulating the Communion of the Church, and the Order of it. Evidence for the Rule of Faith, out of the records of the Church. For the Canons of the Church, and the pedegree of them from the Order eſtabliſhed in the Church by the Apoſtles. That the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and that by being baptized, is neceſſary to the ſalvation of a Chriſtian.

      * CHAP. VIII. That the Power of Governing the whole Church was in the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, and thoſe whom they took to aſſiſt them in the parts of it. The Power of their Succeſſors muſt needs be derived from thoſe. Why that Succeſſion which appeares in one Church, neceſſarily holdeth all Churches. The holding of Councils evidenceth the Ʋnity of the Church.

      * CHAP. IX. The Keyes of the Church given the Apoſtles, and exerciſed by Excommunication under the Apoſtles. The ground thereof is that profeſſion, which, all that are baptized are to make. That Penance and abatemeut of Penance hath been in force ever ſince and under the Apoſtles. In particular, of excluding Hereticks.

      * CHAP. X. Evidence of the Apoſtles act from the effect of it, in preſerving the Ʋnity of the Church. Of the buſineſſe of Marcion and Montanus. That about keeping Eaſter. That of the Novations, of rebaptizing Hereticks, of Paulus Samoſatenus, of Dionyſius Alexandrinus, and Arius. Of communicatory leters, and the intercourſe of the Church under and after the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. XI.Ʋpon what grounds the firſt book de Synedriis holds that the Church cannot excommunicate. Before the Law there was no ſuch Power, nor by it. Chriſtians went for Jewes under the Apoſtles. His ſenſe of ſome Scriptures. What the Leviatha• ſaith in general concerning the Power of the Church. Both ſuppoſe that Eccleſiaſtical Power includeth Temporal, which is not true. Of the Oxford Doctors Paraeneſis.

      * CHAP. XII. That the Law experſly covenanted for the Land of Promiſe. A great Objection againſt this, from the Great precept of the Law. The hope of the world to come under the Law, and the obedience which it requireth, was grounded upon reaſon from the true God, the Tradition of the Fathers, and the Doctrine of the Prophets. The Love of God above all by the Law extendeth no further than the precepts of the Law, the love of our Neighbor onely to Jewes. Of the Ceremonial, Judicial and Moral Law.

      * CHAP. XIII. That the Law tendreth no other promiſe but that of the Land of Canaan. How the Reſurrection is ſignified by the Prophets. Expreſſe texts of the Apoſtles. Their arguments, and the arguments of our Lord do ſuppoſe the myſtical ſenſe of the Scriptures. That this ſenſe is to be made good throughout the Scripture, whereſoever the ground of it takes place; Chriſtianity well grounded ſuppoſing this. What parts of Scripture may be queſtionable, whether they have a myſtical ſenſe or not. The ſayings and doings of our Lord have it; As alſo thoſe paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which are fulfilled by the ſame. The ſenſe of the Fathers.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Leviathans opin•on, that Chriſt came to reſtore that kingdome of God which the Jewes caſt off when they rejected Samuel. It overthroweth the foundation of Chriſtianity. The true Government of Gods ancient people. The name of the Church in the New Teſtament cannot ſignifie the Synagogue. Nor any Chriſtian State.

      * CHAP. XV. How the Power of the Church is founded upon the Law. The Power of the Kingdome, Prieſthood, Prophets, and Rulers of that people all of divine right. How farre theſe qualities and the powers of them are to continue in the Church. The ſenſe of the Fathers in this point. That the acts of S. Paul and the reſt of the Apoſtles were not of force by virtue of the Law. What Eccleſiaſtical Power ſhould have been among the Jewes, in caſe they had received the Goſpel, and ſo the State had ſtood.

      * CHAP. XVI. The Church founded upon the Power given the Apoſtles. What is the ſubject mater of Church Lawes. The right of the Church to Tithes and Oblations is not grounded upon the Law, though evidenced by it, and by practice of the Patriarchs. Evidence of the Apoſtles Order in the Scriptures. The Church of Jeruſalem held not community of Goods. The original practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power of Excommunication in the Church is not founded in the Law. What argument there is of it in the Old Teſtament. The allegorical ſenſe thereof is argumentative. It was not neceſſary that the Chriſtians ſhould incurre perſecution for uſing the Power of the Keyes, and not by virtue of the Law.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The difference between S. Pauls anathema and that of the Jewes. It is not neceſſary that the Chriſtians anathema ſhould ſignifie curſing. That the inceſtuous perſon at Corinth was Excommunicated by S. Paul. Juriſdiction of the Church. Telling the Church, binding and looſing, holding him that is bound for a Heathen or a Publicane, ſigniſie the ſame. The coherence of our Lords diſcourſe. Of Excommunication and Indulgence by private perſons in the Ancient Church. That Excommunication and the Power of the Church could not come in force by the voluntary conſent of the firſt Chriſtians. How it may be ſaid to be voluntary. Of the confederacy of the primitive Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XIX. That Power which was in Churches under the Apoſtles, can never be in any Chriſtian Soveraign. The difference between the Church and the Synagogue in that regard. The intereſt of Secular Power in determining maters of Faith preſuppoſeth the Society of the Church, and the act of it. No man can be bound to profeſſe the contrary of that which hee believeth. Every man is bound to profeſſe that Chriſtianity which hee believeth. The Church is the chief Teacher of Chriſtianity through Chriſtendom, as the Soveraign of Civil Peace, thorough his Dominions. Why the Church is to decide maters of Faith rather than the State, neither being infallible.

      * CHAP. XX. The reſt of the Oxford Doctors pretenſe. The Power of binding and looſing ſuppoſeth not onely the Preaching of the Goſpel, but the outward act of Faith. Chriſtians are not at liberty to caſt themſelves into what formes of Churches the Law of Nature alloweth. They are Judges in chief for themſelves in mater of Religion, ſuppoſing the Catholick Church; not otherwiſe. Secular Power cannot puniſh for Religion, but ſuppoſing the act of the Church, nor do any act to inforce Religion, unleſſe the Church determine the mater of it.

      * CHAP. XXI. How the Tradition of the Church limits the interpretation of Scriptures. How the declaration of the Church becomes a reaſonable mark of Hereſie. That which is not found in the Scriptures may have been delivered by the Apoſtles. Some things delivered by the Apoſtles, and recorded in the Scriptures; may not oblige. S. Auſtines Rule of Apoſtolical Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Authority of the Fathers is not grounded upon any preſumption of their Learning or Holineſſe. How farr they challenge the credit of Hiſtorical truth. The pre-eminenee of the Primitive. The preſumption that is grounded upon their ranks and qualities in the Church. Of Arnobius, Lactantius, Tertullian, Origen, Clemens, and the approbation of poſterity.

      * CHAP. XXIII. Two inſtances againſt the premiſes, beſides the objection concerning the beginning of Antichriſt under the Apoſtles. The general anſwer to it. The ſeven Trumpets in the Apocalypſe fore-tell the deſtruction of the Jewes. The ſeven Vials, the plagues inflicted upon the Empire for the ten perſecutions. The correſpondence of Deniels Propheſie inferreth the ſame. Neither S. Pauls Prophe••e nor S. Johns concerneth any Chriſtian. Neither the opinion of the Chiliaſts, nor the giving of the Euchariſt to Infants new Baptized, Catholick.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Two ſorts of means to reſolve whatſoever is reſolvable concerning the Scripture. Upon what terms the Church may, or is to determine controverſies of Faith. And what obligation that determination produceth. Traditions of the Apoſtles oblige the preſent Church, as the reaſons of them continue or not. Inſtances in our Lords Paſſeover and Euchariſt. Penance under the Apoſtles, and afterwards. S. Pauls vail, eating blood, and things offered to Idols. The power of the Church in limiting theſe Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXV. The power of the Church in limiting even the Traditions of the Apoſtles. Not every abuſe of this power, a ſufficient warrant for particular Churches to reforme themſelves. Hereſie conſiſts in denying ſomething, neceſſary to ſalvation to be believed. Schiſm, in departing from the unity of the Church, whether upon that, or any other cauſe. Implicite Faith no virtue; but the effect of it may be the work of Chriſtian charity.

      * CHAP. XXVI. What it is to adde to Gods Law; What to adde the Apocalypſe. S. Pauls Anathema. The Beraeans. S. Johns Goſpel ſufficient to make one believe; and the Scriptures, The man of God perfit. How the Law giveth light, and Chriſtians are taught by God. How Idolatry is ſaid, not to be commanded by God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. Why it was death to tranſgreſs the determinations of the Jews Conſiſtory, and what power this argueth in the Church. A difference between the authority of the Apoſtles, and that of the Church. The being of the Church to the worlds end, with power of the Keyes, makes it not infallible. Obedience to Superiors, and the Pillar of truth inferre it not.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The Fathers acknowledge the Sufficience and clearneſs of the Scriptures, as, the Traditions of the Church. They are to be reconciled, by limiting the terms which they uſe. The limitation of thoſe ſayings which make all Chriſtian truth to be contained in the Scriptures. Of thoſe which make the authority of the Church the ground of Faith.

      * CHAP. XXXII. Anſwer to an Objection, that choice of Religion becomes difficult upon theſe terms. This reſolution is for the Intereſt of the Reformation. Thoſe that make the Church Infallible cannot, thoſe that make the Scripture clear and ſufficient may own Tradition for evidence to determine the meaning of the Scriptures, and Controverſies of Faith. The Intereſt of the Church of England. The pretenſe of Ruſhworthes Dialogues, that wee have no unqueſtionable Scripture, and, that the Tradition of the Church never changes.

      * CHAP. XXXI. That the Scriptures which wee have are unqueſtionable. That miſtakes in Copying are not conſiderable to the ſenſe and effect of them. The meaning of the Hebrew and Greek, even of the Prophets, determinable, to the deciding of Controverſies. How Religion delivered by Tradition becomes ſubject to be corrupted.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. The Diſpute concerning the Canon of Scripture, and the tranſlations thereof, in two Queſtions. There can be no Tradition for thoſe books that were written ſince Propheſie ceaſed. Wherein the excellence of them above other books lies. The chief objections againſt them are queſtionable. In thoſe parcels of the New Teſtament that have been queſtioned, the caſe is not the ſame. The ſenſe of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Onely the Original Copy can be Authentick. But, the truth thereof may as well be found in the tranſlations of the Old Teſtament, as in the Jewes Copies. The Jewes have not falſified them of malice. The Points come neither from Moſes, nor Eſdras, but from the Talmud Jewes.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. Of the anci•n eſt Tranſlations of the Bible into Greek firſt; With the Authors and authority of the ſame; Then into the Chaldee, Syriack, and Latine. Exceptions againſt the Greek, and the Samaritane Pentateuch. They are helps nevertheleſs to aſſure the true reading of the Scriptures, though with other Copies; whether Jewiſh or Chriſtian. Though the Vulgar Latine were better than the preſent Greek, yet muſt both depend upon the Original Greek of the New Teſta•ent. No danger to Chriſtianity by the differences remaining in the Bible.

      * CHAP. 1. Two parts of that which remains. How the diſpute concerning the Holy Trinity with Socinus belongs to the firſt. The Queſtion of juſtification by Faith alone. The Opinion of Socinus concerning the whole Covenant of Grace. The opinion of thoſe who make juſtifying Faith the knowledge of a mans Predeſtination, oppoſite to it in the other extream. The difference between it and that of the Antinomians. That there are mean Opinions.

      * CHAP. II. Evidence what is the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. The contract of Baptiſm. The promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt annexed to Chriſts, not to Johns Baptiſm. Thoſe are made Chriſts Diſciples as Chriſtians that take up his Croſſe in Baptiſm. The effects of Baptiſm according to the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. III. The exhortations of the Apoſtles, that are drawn from the patterns of the Old Teſtament, ſuppoſe the ſame. How the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament are the ſame, how not the ſame. How the New Teſtament and the New Covenant are both one. The free-will of man acteth the ſame part in dealing about the New-Covenant, as about the Old. The Gospel a Law.

      * CHAP. IV. The conſent of the whole Church evidenced by the cuſtome of chatechiſing. By the opinion thereof concerning the ſalvation of thoſe that delayed their Baptiſm. By the rites and Ceremonies of Baptiſm. Why no penance for ſins before, but after Baptiſm. The doctrine of the Church of England evident in this caſe.

      * CHAP. V. The Preaching of our Lord and his Apoſtles evidenceth, that ſome act of Mans free choice is the condition which it requireth. The correspondence betwen the Old and New Teſtament inferreth the ſame. So do the errors of Socinians and Antinomians concerning the neceſſity of Baptiſm. Objections deferred.

      * CHAP. VI. Juſtifying Faith ſometimes conſiſts in believing the truth. Sometimes, in truſt in God grounded upon the truth. Somtimes in Chriſtianity, that is in imbracing and profeſſing it. And that in the Fathers as well as in the Scriptures. Of the informed and formed Faith of the Schools.

      * CHAP. VII. The laſt ſignification of Faith is properly justifying Faith. The firſt by a Metonymy of the cauſe: The ſecond of the effect. Thoſe that are not juſtified doe truly believe. The truſt of a Chriſtian preſuppoſeth him to be juſtified. All the promiſes of the Goſpel become due at once by the Covenant of Grace. That, to believe that we are Elect or Juſtified, is not Justifying Faith.

      * CHAP. VIII. The objection from S. Paul; We are not juſtified by the Law nor by Workes, but by Grace and by Faith. Not meant of the Goſpel, and the workes that ſuppoſe it. The queſtion that S. Paul ſpeakes to, is of the Law of Moſes and the Workes of it. He ſets thoſe workes in the ſame rank with the workes of the Gentils by the light of nature. The civil and outward workes of the Law may be done by Gentiles. How the Law is a Pedagogue to Chriſt.

      * CHAP. IX. Of the Faith and Juſtification of Abraham and the Patriarkes, according to the Apoſtles. Of the Prophets and righteous men under the Law. Abraham and Rahab the harlot juſtified by workes, if juſtified by Faith. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend upon works which the Goſpell injoyneth. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. X. What Pelagius queſtioneth concerning the Grace of Chriſt, what Socinus further of the ſtate of Chriſt before his birth. The oppoſition between the firſt and ſecond Adam in S. Paul, evidenceth originall ſinne. Coucupiſcence in the unregenerate, and the inability of the Law to ſubdue it, evict the ſame. The ſecond birth by the holy Ghoſt evidenceth that the first birth propagateth ſinne.

      * CHAP. X. The Old Teſtament chargeth all men as well as the wicked to be ſinfull from the wombe. David complaineth of himſelfe as born in ſinne, no leſſe then the Wiſe man of the children of the Gentiles. How Leviticall Lawes argue the ſame. And temporall death under the Old Teſtament. The book of Wiſdome and the Greek Bible.

Where and when the Haereſie of Cerinthus prevailed, and, that they were Gnoſticks. The beginning of the Encratites under the Apostles. It is evident that one God in Trinity was then glorified among the Christians, by the Fullneſſe of the Godhead which they introduced in ſtead of it.

      * CHAP. XIII. The Word was at the beginning of all things. The apparitions of the Old Teſtament Prefaces to the Incarnation of Chriſt. Ambaſſadors are not honoured with the honour due to their Maſters. The Word of God that was afterwards incarnate was in thoſe Angels that ſpoke in Gods Name. No Angel honoured as God under the New Teſtament. The Word was with God at the beginning of all things, as after his return.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Name of God not aſcribed to Chriſt for the like reaſon as to creatures. The reaſons why the Socinians worſhip Chriſt as God do confute their limitations. Chriſt not God by virtue of his riſing againe. He is the Great God with S. Paul, the true God, with S. John, the onely Lord, with S. Jude. Other Scriptures. Of the forme of God, and of a ſervant in S. Paul.

      * CHAP. XV. Not onely the Church but the World was made by Chriſt. The Word was made fleſh in oppoſition to the Spirit. How the Prophets, how Chriſtians, by receiving the Word of God, are poſſeſſed by his Spirit. How the title of Sonne of God importeth the Godhead. How Chriſt is the brightneſſe and Image of God.

      * CHAP. XVI. The teſtimonies of Chriſts Godhead in the Old Teſtament are firſt underſtood of the figures of Chriſt. Of the Wiſdome of God in Solomon and elſewhere. Of the writings of the Jewes as well before as after Chriſt.

      * CHAP. XVII. Anſwer to thoſe texts of Scripture that ſeem to abate the true Godhead in Chriſt. Of that creature whereof Chriſt is the firſt-borne, and that which the Wiſdome of God made. That this beliefe is the originall Tradition of the Church. What meanes this diſpute furniſheth us with againſt the Arrians. That it is reaſon to ſubmit to revelation concerning the nature of God. The uſe of reaſon is no way renounced by holding this Faith.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The neceſſity of the grace of Chriſt, is the evidence of originall ſinne. How the exaltation of our Lord depends upon his humiliation, and the grace of Christ upon that▪ All the work of Chriſtianity is aſcribed to the grace of Chriſt. Gods predeſtination manifeſteth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XIX. Evidences of the ſame in the Old Teſtament; Of Gods help in getting the Land of Promiſe, and renewing the Covenant: And that for Chriſts ſake. That Chriſtianity cannot ſtand without acknowledging the grace of Chriſt. The Tradition of the Church; In the Baptiſme of Infants: In the Prayers of the Church; In the decrees against Pelagius and other records of the Church.

      * CHAP. XX. Wherein Originall ſinne conſiſteth; What opinions are on foot. That it is not Adams ſinne imputed to his poſterity. Whether man were at the firſt created to a ſupernaturall end, or not. An eſtate of meer nature, but innocent, poſſible. Originall ſinne is Concupiſcence. How Baptiſme voids it. Concerning the late novelty in the Church of England about Originall ſinne.

      * CHAP. XXI. The opinion that mak•s the Predetermination of mans will by God the ſourſe of his freedom; And wherein Janſenius differs from it. Of neceſsity upon ſuppoſition & abſolute. The neceſsity of the Will following the last dictate of the underſtanding is onely upon ſuppoſition, As alſo that which Gods foreſight creates. The difference between indifferent and undetermined.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Goſpel findeth man free from neceſſity, though not from bondage. Of the Antecedent and Conſequent Will of God. Praedetermination not the root, but the rooting up of Freedome and of Chriſtianity. Againſt the opinion of Janſenius.

      * CHAP. XXIII. A man is able to doe things truely honeſt under Originall ſin. But not to make God the end of all his doings. How all the actions of the Gentiles are ſins. They are accountable onely for the Law of nature. How all men have or have not Grace ſufficient to ſave.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Though God determineth not the will immediately, yet he determineth the effect thereof by the meanes of his providence, preſenting the object ſo as he foreſees it will chuſe, The caſes of Pharoah, of Solomon, of Ahab, and of the Jewes that crucified Chriſt. Of Gods foreknowledg of future conditionalls that come not to paſſe. The ground of foreknowledg of future contingencies. Difficult objections anſwered.

      * CHAP. XXV. The grounds of the difference between ſufficient and effectuall. How naturall occaſions, conduce to ſupernaturall actions, The inſufficience of Janſenius his doctrine. Of ſufficient grace under the Law of Moſes and Nature.

      * CHAP. XXVI. Predeſtination to grace abſolute, to glory reſpective: Purpoſe of denying effectuall Grace abſolute, of puniſhing reſpective. The end, to which God predeſtinates, is not the end for which he predeſtinates. Grace the reward of the right uſe of Grace. How much of the queſtion the Goſpell determines not. That our indeavours are ingaged no leſſe, then if predeſtination were not, it determineth. Of the Tradition of the Church; and of Semipelagians, Predeſtinatians and Arminians.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The queſtion concerning the ſatisfaction of Chriſt with Socinus. The reaſon why Sacrifices are figures of Chriſt, common to all ſacrifices. Why, and what Sacrifices the Fathers had, what the Law added. Of our ranſom by the price of Chriſts propitiatory Sacrifice.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Chriſt took away our ſinne by bearing the puniſhment of it. The Propheſie of Eſay LIII. We are reconciled to God by the Goſpel, in conſideration of Chriſts obedience. The reconcilement of Jews and Gentiles, Men and Angels, conſequent to the ſame. Of purging and expiating ſinne by Chriſt, and making propitiation for it. Of Chriſts dying for us.

      * CHAP. XXIX. The grant of Grace, in conſideration of Chriſt, ſuppoſes ſatisfaction made by him for ſinne. Neither our ſinnes imputable to Chriſt, nor his ſufferings to us, formally and perſonally, but, as the meritorious cauſes which ſatisfaction anſwereth. The effect of it, the Covenant of Grace, as well as help to performe it. The Fathers ſaved by the Faith of Chriſt to come. The Goſpel a new Law. The property of Satisfaction and Puniſhment in Chriſts ſufferings. Of the ſenſe of the Catholike Church.

      * CHAP. XXX. God might have reconciled man to himſelf without the coming of Chriſt. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend as well upon his active as paſſive obedience. Chriſt need not ſuffer •ell pa•nes that we might not. The opinion that maketh juſtifying Faith to be truſt in God not true; Yet not prejudiciall to the Faith. The decree of the Council of Trent, and the doctrine of the Schoole; how it is not prejudiciall to the Faith. As alſo that of Socinus.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ſtate of the queſtion concerning the perſeverance of thoſe that are once juſtified. Of three ſenſes, one true, one inconſiſtent with the Faith, the third neither true nor yet deſtructive to the Faith. Evidence from the writings of the Apoſtles. From the Old Teſtament. The grace of Propheſie when it preſuppoſeth ſanctifying grace. Anſwer to ſome Texts, and of S. Pauls meaning in the VII. of the Romans. Of the Polygamy of the Fathers.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Whether any workes of Chriſtians be ſatisfactory for ſinne, and meritorious of heaven, or not. The recovery of Gods grace for a Chriſtian fallen from it, a work of labour and time. The neceſſity and efficacy of Penance to that purpoſe, according to the Scriptures, and the practiſe of the Church. Merit by virtue of Gods promiſe, neceſſary. The Catholicke Church agrees in it, the preſent Church of Rome allowes merit of juſtice▪

      * CHAP. I. The Society of the Church founded upon the duty of communicating in the Offices of Gods Service. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt, among thoſe Offices, proper to Chriſtianity. What opinions, concerning the preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood in the Euchariſt, are on foot.

      * CHAP. II. That the natural ſubſtance of the Elements remains in the Sacrament. That the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is nevertheleſſe preſent in the ſame, when it is received, not by the receiving of it. The eating of the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe neceſſarily requireth the ſame. This cauſes no contradiction nor improperty in the words of our Lord.

      * CHAP. III. That the preſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt depends not upon the living Faith of him that receives, but upon the true profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the Church that celebrates. The Scriptures that are alleged for the dependence of it upon the communication of the properties. They conclude not the ſenſe of them by whom they are alleged. How the Scripture confineth the fleſh of Chriſt to the Heavens.

      * CHAP. IV. The opinion which maketh the Conſecration to be done by rehearſing the operative words. That our Lord conſecrated by Thanksgiving. The Form of it in all Liturgies, together with the conſent of the Fathers. Evidence, that there is no Tradition of the Church for the aboliſhing of the Elements.

      * CHAP. V. It cannot be proved by the Old Teſtament that the Euchariſt is a Sacrifice. How, by the New Teſtament it may be ſo accounted. Four reaſons thereof, depending upon the nature of Juſtifying Faith premiſed. The conſent of the Catholick Church. The concurrence of the Church of England to the premiſes.

      * CHAP. VI. The reaſon of the Order by which I proceed, brings me to the Baptiſm of Infants in the next place. The power of the Keyes ſeen in granting Baptiſm, as well as in communicating the Euchariſt. Why Socinians make Baptiſm indifferent: Why Antinomians make it a miſtake to Baptize. The grounds upon which I ſhake off both: With anſwer to ſome objections.

      * CHAP. VII. The ground of baptizing Infants Originall ſinne, though not inſtituted till Chriſt roſe again. No other cure for it. Infants of Chriſtians may be Diſciples, are holy. The effect of Circumciſion under the Law, inferreth the effect of Baptiſm under the Goſpel.

      * CHAP. VIII. What is alleadged to impeach Tradition for baptizing Infants; Proves not, that any could be ſaved regularly, who dyed unbaptized; but, that, baptizing at yeares was a ſtrong means to make good Chriſtians. Why the Church now Baptize, Infants. What becomes of Infants dying unbaptized, unanſwerable. What thoſe Infants g•t who dye baptized.

      * CHAP. IX. What controverſie the Reformation hath with the Church of Rome about Penance. Inward repentance that is ſincere, obtaineth pardon alone. Remiſſion of ſinnes by the Goſpel onely: The condition of it by the Miniſtrey of the Church. What the power of binding and looſing contains more then Preaching, or taking away offenſes. Sinne may be pardoned without the uſe of it. Wherein the neceſſity of uſing it lyeth.

      * CHAP. X. The Sects of the Montaniſts, Novations, Donatiſts, and Meletians, evidence the cure of ſinne by Penance, to be a Tradition of the Apoſtles. So doth the agreement of primitive practice with their writings. Indulgence of regular Penance from the Apoſtles. Confeſſion of ſecret ſinnes in the Primitive Church. That no ſinne can be cured without the Keyes of the Church, there is no Tradition from the Apoſtles. The neceſſity of confeſſing ſecret ſinnes, whereupon it ſtands.

      * CHAP. IX. Penance is not required to redeem tho debt of temporall puniſhment when the ſinne is pardoned. What aſſurance of forgiveneſſe, the law of auricular Confeſſion, as it is uſed in the Church of Rome, procureth Of injoyning Penance, after abſolution performed. Setting aſide abuſes, the Law is agreeable to Gods. Of the order taken by the Church of England.

      * CHAP. XI. The Unction of the ſick pretendeth onely bodily health, upon ſuppoſition of the cure of ſinne by the Keyes of the Church. Objections anſwered. The Tradition of the Church evidenceth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XII. The ground of the Right of the Church in Matrimonial cauſes. Mariage of one with one inſolubly is a Law of Chriſtianity; The Law of Moſes not injoyning it. The Law of the Empire not aiming at the ground of it. Evidence from the primitive practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XIV. Scripture alleged to prove the bond of Mariage inſoluble in caſe of adultery, uneffectuall. S. Paul and our Lord ſpeak both to one purpoſe, according to S. Jerome, and S. Auſtine. The contrary opinion more reaſonable, and more general in the Church. Why the Church may reſtrain the innocent party from marying again. The Imperial Lawes could never be of force to void the Power of the Church. Evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIV. Another opinion, admitting the ground of lawfull Impediments. What Impediments ariſe upon the Conſtitution of the Church, generally as a Society, or particularly, as of Chriſtians.

Of Alexandria, Antiochia, Jeruſalem and Rome. Ground for the pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, before all Churches. The conſequence of that Ground. A ſummary of the evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIX. Of the proceedings about Marcion and Montanus at Rome. The buſineſse of Pope Victor about keeping Eaſter; a peremptory inſtance. The buſineſſe of the Novatians evidenceth the ſame. Of the buſineſſes concerning the rebaptizing of Hereticks, Dionyſius of Alexandria, Paulus Samoſatenus, S. Cypriane, and, of the Donatiſts under Conſtantine.

      * CHAP. XX. Of the conſtitution and authority of Councils. The ground of the pre-eminences of Churches in the Romane Empire. The VI. Canon of the Council of Nicaea. The pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, and that of Conſtantinople. Some inſtances againſt the ſuperiority of Biſhops, out of the records of the Church; what offices every Order by Gods Law, or by Canon Law, miniſtreth.

      * CHAP. XXI. Of the times of God ſervice; By what Title of his Law the firſt day of the week is kept Holy. How the Sabbath is to be ſanctified by Moſes Law.

      * CHAP. XXII. The people of God •ied to build Synagogues, though not by the leter of the Law. The Church to provide Churches, though the Scripture command it not. Preſcribing the form of Gods publick ſervice, is not quenching the Spirit. The Pſalter is preſcribed the Church for Gods Praiſes.

      * CHAP. XXIII. The conſideration of the Euchariſt preſcribed by Tradition, for the mater of it. Lords Prayer preſcribed in all ſervices. The mater of Prayers for all eſtates preſcribed. The form of Baptiſm neceſſary to be preſcribed. The ſame reaſon holdeth in the forms of other Offices.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Prayer the more principall Office of Gods ſervice then Preaching. Preachings, neither Gods word, nor the meanes of ſalvation, unleſſe limited to the Faith of Gods Church.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The Soules of the Fathers were not in the Devils Power till Chriſt; Though the Old Teſtament declare not their eſtate. Of Samuels ſoul. The ſoul of our Lord Chriſt, parting from his body, went with the Thiefe to Paradiſe. Of his triumph over the powers of darkneſſe. Prayer for the dead ſignifieth no delivering of ſoules out of Purgatory. The Covenant of Grace requires imperfect happineſſe before the generall judgement. Of forgiveneſſe in the world to come, and, paying the utmoſt farthing.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Ancient opinions in the Church, of the place of ſoules before the day of judgement. No Tradition that the Fathers were in the Ʋerge of Hell, under the Earth.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ground for a Monaſticall life in the Scriptures; And in the practice of the primitive Church. The Church getteth no peculiar intereſt in them who profeſſe it, by their profeſſing of it. The nature and intent of it renders it ſubordinate to the Clergy. How farre the ſingle life of the Clergy hath been a Law to the Church. Inexecution of the Canons for it. Nullity of the proceeddings of the Church of Rome in it. The intereſt of the People in the acts of the Church; And in the uſe of the Scriptures.

    _ The Third BOOK.

      * CHAP. I. All agree, that Reaſon is to decide controverſies of Faith. The objection, that Faith is taught by Gods Spirit, anſwered. What Reaſon decideth queſtions of Faith. The reſolution of Faith ends not in the light of Reaſon, but in that which Reaſon evidenceth to come from Gods meſſengers.

      * CHAP. II. The queſtion between the Scripture and the Church, which of them is Judge in matters of Faith. Whether opinion, the Tradition of the Church ſtands better with. Thoſe that hold the Scripture to be clear in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, have no reaſon to exclude the Tradition of the Church. What opinions they are, that deny the Church to be a Society or Corporation by Gods Law.

      * CHAP. III. That neither the ſentence of the Church, nor the dictate of Gods Spirit, can be the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be received. No man can know that hee hath Gods Spirit, without knowing that hee is a true Chriſtian; Which ſuppoſeth the truth of the Scripture. The motives of Faith are the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be believed: And the conſent of Gods people the reaſon that evidences thoſe motives to be infallibly true. How the Scriptures are believed for themſelves. How a Circle is made in rendering a reaſon of the Faith. The Scriptures are Gods Law to all, to whom they are publiſhed, by Gods act of publiſhing them; But Civil Law, by the act of Soveraign Powers, in acting Chriſtianity upon their Subjects.

      * CHAP. IV. Neither the Dictate of Gods Spirit nor the authority of the Church is the reaſon of believing any thing in Chriſtianity. Whether the Church be before the Scripture, or the Scripture before the Church. The Scriptures contain not the Infallibility of the Church. Nor the conſent of all Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. V. All things neceſſary to ſalvation are not clear in the Scriptures to all underſtandings. Not in the Old Teſtament. Not in the Goſpel. Not in the Writings of the Apoſtles. It is neceſſary to ſalvation to believe more than this, that our Lord is the Chriſt. Time cauſeth obſcurity in the Scriptures, aſwell as in other Records. That it is no where ſaid in the Scriptures, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are clear in the Scriptures. Neither is there any conſent of all Chriſtians to evidence the ſame.

      * CHAP. VI. All interpretation of Scripture is to be confined within the Tradition of the Church. This ſuppoſeth that the Church is a Communion inſtituted by God. What means there is to make evidence of Gods Charter, upon which the Corporation of the Church ſubſiſteth. The name of the Church, in the Scriptures, often ſignifieth the Whole or Cathelick Church.

      * CHAP. VII. That the Apoſtles delivered to the Church a Summary of Chriſtianity, which, all ſhould be baptized were to profeſs. Evidence out of the Scriptures. Evidence out of the Scriptures for Tradition regulating the Communion of the Church, and the Order of it. Evidence for the Rule of Faith, out of the records of the Church. For the Canons of the Church, and the pedegree of them from the Order eſtabliſhed in the Church by the Apoſtles. That the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and that by being baptized, is neceſſary to the ſalvation of a Chriſtian.

      * CHAP. VIII. That the Power of Governing the whole Church was in the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, and thoſe whom they took to aſſiſt them in the parts of it. The Power of their Succeſſors muſt needs be derived from thoſe. Why that Succeſſion which appeares in one Church, neceſſarily holdeth all Churches. The holding of Councils evidenceth the Ʋnity of the Church.

      * CHAP. IX. The Keyes of the Church given the Apoſtles, and exerciſed by Excommunication under the Apoſtles. The ground thereof is that profeſſion, which, all that are baptized are to make. That Penance and abatemeut of Penance hath been in force ever ſince and under the Apoſtles. In particular, of excluding Hereticks.

      * CHAP. X. Evidence of the Apoſtles act from the effect of it, in preſerving the Ʋnity of the Church. Of the buſineſſe of Marcion and Montanus. That about keeping Eaſter. That of the Novations, of rebaptizing Hereticks, of Paulus Samoſatenus, of Dionyſius Alexandrinus, and Arius. Of communicatory leters, and the intercourſe of the Church under and after the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. XI.Ʋpon what grounds the firſt book de Synedriis holds that the Church cannot excommunicate. Before the Law there was no ſuch Power, nor by it. Chriſtians went for Jewes under the Apoſtles. His ſenſe of ſome Scriptures. What the Leviatha• ſaith in general concerning the Power of the Church. Both ſuppoſe that Eccleſiaſtical Power includeth Temporal, which is not true. Of the Oxford Doctors Paraeneſis.

      * CHAP. XII. That the Law experſly covenanted for the Land of Promiſe. A great Objection againſt this, from the Great precept of the Law. The hope of the world to come under the Law, and the obedience which it requireth, was grounded upon reaſon from the true God, the Tradition of the Fathers, and the Doctrine of the Prophets. The Love of God above all by the Law extendeth no further than the precepts of the Law, the love of our Neighbor onely to Jewes. Of the Ceremonial, Judicial and Moral Law.

      * CHAP. XIII. That the Law tendreth no other promiſe but that of the Land of Canaan. How the Reſurrection is ſignified by the Prophets. Expreſſe texts of the Apoſtles. Their arguments, and the arguments of our Lord do ſuppoſe the myſtical ſenſe of the Scriptures. That this ſenſe is to be made good throughout the Scripture, whereſoever the ground of it takes place; Chriſtianity well grounded ſuppoſing this. What parts of Scripture may be queſtionable, whether they have a myſtical ſenſe or not. The ſayings and doings of our Lord have it; As alſo thoſe paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which are fulfilled by the ſame. The ſenſe of the Fathers.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Leviathans opin•on, that Chriſt came to reſtore that kingdome of God which the Jewes caſt off when they rejected Samuel. It overthroweth the foundation of Chriſtianity. The true Government of Gods ancient people. The name of the Church in the New Teſtament cannot ſignifie the Synagogue. Nor any Chriſtian State.

      * CHAP. XV. How the Power of the Church is founded upon the Law. The Power of the Kingdome, Prieſthood, Prophets, and Rulers of that people all of divine right. How farre theſe qualities and the powers of them are to continue in the Church. The ſenſe of the Fathers in this point. That the acts of S. Paul and the reſt of the Apoſtles were not of force by virtue of the Law. What Eccleſiaſtical Power ſhould have been among the Jewes, in caſe they had received the Goſpel, and ſo the State had ſtood.

      * CHAP. XVI. The Church founded upon the Power given the Apoſtles. What is the ſubject mater of Church Lawes. The right of the Church to Tithes and Oblations is not grounded upon the Law, though evidenced by it, and by practice of the Patriarchs. Evidence of the Apoſtles Order in the Scriptures. The Church of Jeruſalem held not community of Goods. The original practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power of Excommunication in the Church is not founded in the Law. What argument there is of it in the Old Teſtament. The allegorical ſenſe thereof is argumentative. It was not neceſſary that the Chriſtians ſhould incurre perſecution for uſing the Power of the Keyes, and not by virtue of the Law.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The difference between S. Pauls anathema and that of the Jewes. It is not neceſſary that the Chriſtians anathema ſhould ſignifie curſing. That the inceſtuous perſon at Corinth was Excommunicated by S. Paul. Juriſdiction of the Church. Telling the Church, binding and looſing, holding him that is bound for a Heathen or a Publicane, ſigniſie the ſame. The coherence of our Lords diſcourſe. Of Excommunication and Indulgence by private perſons in the Ancient Church. That Excommunication and the Power of the Church could not come in force by the voluntary conſent of the firſt Chriſtians. How it may be ſaid to be voluntary. Of the confederacy of the primitive Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XIX. That Power which was in Churches under the Apoſtles, can never be in any Chriſtian Soveraign. The difference between the Church and the Synagogue in that regard. The intereſt of Secular Power in determining maters of Faith preſuppoſeth the Society of the Church, and the act of it. No man can be bound to profeſſe the contrary of that which hee believeth. Every man is bound to profeſſe that Chriſtianity which hee believeth. The Church is the chief Teacher of Chriſtianity through Chriſtendom, as the Soveraign of Civil Peace, thorough his Dominions. Why the Church is to decide maters of Faith rather than the State, neither being infallible.

      * CHAP. XX. The reſt of the Oxford Doctors pretenſe. The Power of binding and looſing ſuppoſeth not onely the Preaching of the Goſpel, but the outward act of Faith. Chriſtians are not at liberty to caſt themſelves into what formes of Churches the Law of Nature alloweth. They are Judges in chief for themſelves in mater of Religion, ſuppoſing the Catholick Church; not otherwiſe. Secular Power cannot puniſh for Religion, but ſuppoſing the act of the Church, nor do any act to inforce Religion, unleſſe the Church determine the mater of it.

      * CHAP. XXI. How the Tradition of the Church limits the interpretation of Scriptures. How the declaration of the Church becomes a reaſonable mark of Hereſie. That which is not found in the Scriptures may have been delivered by the Apoſtles. Some things delivered by the Apoſtles, and recorded in the Scriptures; may not oblige. S. Auſtines Rule of Apoſtolical Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Authority of the Fathers is not grounded upon any preſumption of their Learning or Holineſſe. How farr they challenge the credit of Hiſtorical truth. The pre-eminenee of the Primitive. The preſumption that is grounded upon their ranks and qualities in the Church. Of Arnobius, Lactantius, Tertullian, Origen, Clemens, and the approbation of poſterity.

      * CHAP. XXIII. Two inſtances againſt the premiſes, beſides the objection concerning the beginning of Antichriſt under the Apoſtles. The general anſwer to it. The ſeven Trumpets in the Apocalypſe fore-tell the deſtruction of the Jewes. The ſeven Vials, the plagues inflicted upon the Empire for the ten perſecutions. The correſpondence of Deniels Propheſie inferreth the ſame. Neither S. Pauls Prophe••e nor S. Johns concerneth any Chriſtian. Neither the opinion of the Chiliaſts, nor the giving of the Euchariſt to Infants new Baptized, Catholick.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Two ſorts of means to reſolve whatſoever is reſolvable concerning the Scripture. Upon what terms the Church may, or is to determine controverſies of Faith. And what obligation that determination produceth. Traditions of the Apoſtles oblige the preſent Church, as the reaſons of them continue or not. Inſtances in our Lords Paſſeover and Euchariſt. Penance under the Apoſtles, and afterwards. S. Pauls vail, eating blood, and things offered to Idols. The power of the Church in limiting theſe Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXV. The power of the Church in limiting even the Traditions of the Apoſtles. Not every abuſe of this power, a ſufficient warrant for particular Churches to reforme themſelves. Hereſie conſiſts in denying ſomething, neceſſary to ſalvation to be believed. Schiſm, in departing from the unity of the Church, whether upon that, or any other cauſe. Implicite Faith no virtue; but the effect of it may be the work of Chriſtian charity.

      * CHAP. XXVI. What it is to adde to Gods Law; What to adde the Apocalypſe. S. Pauls Anathema. The Beraeans. S. Johns Goſpel ſufficient to make one believe; and the Scriptures, The man of God perfit. How the Law giveth light, and Chriſtians are taught by God. How Idolatry is ſaid, not to be commanded by God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. Why it was death to tranſgreſs the determinations of the Jews Conſiſtory, and what power this argueth in the Church. A difference between the authority of the Apoſtles, and that of the Church. The being of the Church to the worlds end, with power of the Keyes, makes it not infallible. Obedience to Superiors, and the Pillar of truth inferre it not.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The Fathers acknowledge the Sufficience and clearneſs of the Scriptures, as, the Traditions of the Church. They are to be reconciled, by limiting the terms which they uſe. The limitation of thoſe ſayings which make all Chriſtian truth to be contained in the Scriptures. Of thoſe which make the authority of the Church the ground of Faith.

      * CHAP. XXXII. Anſwer to an Objection, that choice of Religion becomes difficult upon theſe terms. This reſolution is for the Intereſt of the Reformation. Thoſe that make the Church Infallible cannot, thoſe that make the Scripture clear and ſufficient may own Tradition for evidence to determine the meaning of the Scriptures, and Controverſies of Faith. The Intereſt of the Church of England. The pretenſe of Ruſhworthes Dialogues, that wee have no unqueſtionable Scripture, and, that the Tradition of the Church never changes.

      * CHAP. XXXI. That the Scriptures which wee have are unqueſtionable. That miſtakes in Copying are not conſiderable to the ſenſe and effect of them. The meaning of the Hebrew and Greek, even of the Prophets, determinable, to the deciding of Controverſies. How Religion delivered by Tradition becomes ſubject to be corrupted.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. The Diſpute concerning the Canon of Scripture, and the tranſlations thereof, in two Queſtions. There can be no Tradition for thoſe books that were written ſince Propheſie ceaſed. Wherein the excellence of them above other books lies. The chief objections againſt them are queſtionable. In thoſe parcels of the New Teſtament that have been queſtioned, the caſe is not the ſame. The ſenſe of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Onely the Original Copy can be Authentick. But, the truth thereof may as well be found in the tranſlations of the Old Teſtament, as in the Jewes Copies. The Jewes have not falſified them of malice. The Points come neither from Moſes, nor Eſdras, but from the Talmud Jewes.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. Of the anci•n eſt Tranſlations of the Bible into Greek firſt; With the Authors and authority of the ſame; Then into the Chaldee, Syriack, and Latine. Exceptions againſt the Greek, and the Samaritane Pentateuch. They are helps nevertheleſs to aſſure the true reading of the Scriptures, though with other Copies; whether Jewiſh or Chriſtian. Though the Vulgar Latine were better than the preſent Greek, yet muſt both depend upon the Original Greek of the New Teſta•ent. No danger to Chriſtianity by the differences remaining in the Bible.

      * CHAP. 1. Two parts of that which remains. How the diſpute concerning the Holy Trinity with Socinus belongs to the firſt. The Queſtion of juſtification by Faith alone. The Opinion of Socinus concerning the whole Covenant of Grace. The opinion of thoſe who make juſtifying Faith the knowledge of a mans Predeſtination, oppoſite to it in the other extream. The difference between it and that of the Antinomians. That there are mean Opinions.

      * CHAP. II. Evidence what is the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. The contract of Baptiſm. The promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt annexed to Chriſts, not to Johns Baptiſm. Thoſe are made Chriſts Diſciples as Chriſtians that take up his Croſſe in Baptiſm. The effects of Baptiſm according to the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. III. The exhortations of the Apoſtles, that are drawn from the patterns of the Old Teſtament, ſuppoſe the ſame. How the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament are the ſame, how not the ſame. How the New Teſtament and the New Covenant are both one. The free-will of man acteth the ſame part in dealing about the New-Covenant, as about the Old. The Gospel a Law.

      * CHAP. IV. The conſent of the whole Church evidenced by the cuſtome of chatechiſing. By the opinion thereof concerning the ſalvation of thoſe that delayed their Baptiſm. By the rites and Ceremonies of Baptiſm. Why no penance for ſins before, but after Baptiſm. The doctrine of the Church of England evident in this caſe.

      * CHAP. V. The Preaching of our Lord and his Apoſtles evidenceth, that ſome act of Mans free choice is the condition which it requireth. The correspondence betwen the Old and New Teſtament inferreth the ſame. So do the errors of Socinians and Antinomians concerning the neceſſity of Baptiſm. Objections deferred.

      * CHAP. VI. Juſtifying Faith ſometimes conſiſts in believing the truth. Sometimes, in truſt in God grounded upon the truth. Somtimes in Chriſtianity, that is in imbracing and profeſſing it. And that in the Fathers as well as in the Scriptures. Of the informed and formed Faith of the Schools.

      * CHAP. VII. The laſt ſignification of Faith is properly justifying Faith. The firſt by a Metonymy of the cauſe: The ſecond of the effect. Thoſe that are not juſtified doe truly believe. The truſt of a Chriſtian preſuppoſeth him to be juſtified. All the promiſes of the Goſpel become due at once by the Covenant of Grace. That, to believe that we are Elect or Juſtified, is not Justifying Faith.

      * CHAP. VIII. The objection from S. Paul; We are not juſtified by the Law nor by Workes, but by Grace and by Faith. Not meant of the Goſpel, and the workes that ſuppoſe it. The queſtion that S. Paul ſpeakes to, is of the Law of Moſes and the Workes of it. He ſets thoſe workes in the ſame rank with the workes of the Gentils by the light of nature. The civil and outward workes of the Law may be done by Gentiles. How the Law is a Pedagogue to Chriſt.

      * CHAP. IX. Of the Faith and Juſtification of Abraham and the Patriarkes, according to the Apoſtles. Of the Prophets and righteous men under the Law. Abraham and Rahab the harlot juſtified by workes, if juſtified by Faith. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend upon works which the Goſpell injoyneth. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. X. What Pelagius queſtioneth concerning the Grace of Chriſt, what Socinus further of the ſtate of Chriſt before his birth. The oppoſition between the firſt and ſecond Adam in S. Paul, evidenceth originall ſinne. Coucupiſcence in the unregenerate, and the inability of the Law to ſubdue it, evict the ſame. The ſecond birth by the holy Ghoſt evidenceth that the first birth propagateth ſinne.

      * CHAP. X. The Old Teſtament chargeth all men as well as the wicked to be ſinfull from the wombe. David complaineth of himſelfe as born in ſinne, no leſſe then the Wiſe man of the children of the Gentiles. How Leviticall Lawes argue the ſame. And temporall death under the Old Teſtament. The book of Wiſdome and the Greek Bible.

      * CHAP. XII. The Haereſie of Simon Magus the beginning of the Gnoſticks. That they were in being during the Apoſtles time. Where and when the Haereſie of Cerinthus prevailed, and, that they were Gnoſticks. The beginning of the Encratites under the Apostles. It is evident that one God in Trinity was then glorified among the Christians, by the Fullneſſe of the Godhead which they introduced in ſtead of it.

      * CHAP. XIII. The Word was at the beginning of all things. The apparitions of the Old Teſtament Prefaces to the Incarnation of Chriſt. Ambaſſadors are not honoured with the honour due to their Maſters. The Word of God that was afterwards incarnate was in thoſe Angels that ſpoke in Gods Name. No Angel honoured as God under the New Teſtament. The Word was with God at the beginning of all things, as after his return.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Name of God not aſcribed to Chriſt for the like reaſon as to creatures. The reaſons why the Socinians worſhip Chriſt as God do confute their limitations. Chriſt not God by virtue of his riſing againe. He is the Great God with S. Paul, the true God, with S. John, the onely Lord, with S. Jude. Other Scriptures. Of the forme of God, and of a ſervant in S. Paul.

      * CHAP. XV. Not onely the Church but the World was made by Chriſt. The Word was made fleſh in oppoſition to the Spirit. How the Prophets, how Chriſtians, by receiving the Word of God, are poſſeſſed by his Spirit. How the title of Sonne of God importeth the Godhead. How Chriſt is the brightneſſe and Image of God.

      * CHAP. XVI. The teſtimonies of Chriſts Godhead in the Old Teſtament are firſt underſtood of the figures of Chriſt. Of the Wiſdome of God in Solomon and elſewhere. Of the writings of the Jewes as well before as after Chriſt.

      * CHAP. XVII. Anſwer to thoſe texts of Scripture that ſeem to abate the true Godhead in Chriſt. Of that creature whereof Chriſt is the firſt-borne, and that which the Wiſdome of God made. That this beliefe is the originall Tradition of the Church. What meanes this diſpute furniſheth us with againſt the Arrians. That it is reaſon to ſubmit to revelation concerning the nature of God. The uſe of reaſon is no way renounced by holding this Faith.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The neceſſity of the grace of Chriſt, is the evidence of originall ſinne. How the exaltation of our Lord depends upon his humiliation, and the grace of Christ upon that▪ All the work of Chriſtianity is aſcribed to the grace of Chriſt. Gods predeſtination manifeſteth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XIX. Evidences of the ſame in the Old Teſtament; Of Gods help in getting the Land of Promiſe, and renewing the Covenant: And that for Chriſts ſake. That Chriſtianity cannot ſtand without acknowledging the grace of Chriſt. The Tradition of the Church; In the Baptiſme of Infants: In the Prayers of the Church; In the decrees against Pelagius and other records of the Church.

      * CHAP. XX. Wherein Originall ſinne conſiſteth; What opinions are on foot. That it is not Adams ſinne imputed to his poſterity. Whether man were at the firſt created to a ſupernaturall end, or not. An eſtate of meer nature, but innocent, poſſible. Originall ſinne is Concupiſcence. How Baptiſme voids it. Concerning the late novelty in the Church of England about Originall ſinne.

      * CHAP. XXI. The opinion that mak•s the Predetermination of mans will by God the ſourſe of his freedom; And wherein Janſenius differs from it. Of neceſsity upon ſuppoſition & abſolute. The neceſsity of the Will following the last dictate of the underſtanding is onely upon ſuppoſition, As alſo that which Gods foreſight creates. The difference between indifferent and undetermined.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Goſpel findeth man free from neceſſity, though not from bondage. Of the Antecedent and Conſequent Will of God. Praedetermination not the root, but the rooting up of Freedome and of Chriſtianity. Againſt the opinion of Janſenius.

      * CHAP. XXIII. A man is able to doe things truely honeſt under Originall ſin. But not to make God the end of all his doings. How all the actions of the Gentiles are ſins. They are accountable onely for the Law of nature. How all men have or have not Grace ſufficient to ſave.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Though God determineth not the will immediately, yet he determineth the effect thereof by the meanes of his providence, preſenting the object ſo as he foreſees it will chuſe, The caſes of Pharoah, of Solomon, of Ahab, and of the Jewes that crucified Chriſt. Of Gods foreknowledg of future conditionalls that come not to paſſe. The ground of foreknowledg of future contingencies. Difficult objections anſwered.

      * CHAP. XXV. The grounds of the difference between ſufficient and effectuall. How naturall occaſions, conduce to ſupernaturall actions, The inſufficience of Janſenius his doctrine. Of ſufficient grace under the Law of Moſes and Nature.

      * CHAP. XXVI. Predeſtination to grace abſolute, to glory reſpective: Purpoſe of denying effectuall Grace abſolute, of puniſhing reſpective. The end, to which God predeſtinates, is not the end for which he predeſtinates. Grace the reward of the right uſe of Grace. How much of the queſtion the Goſpell determines not. That our indeavours are ingaged no leſſe, then if predeſtination were not, it determineth. Of the Tradition of the Church; and of Semipelagians, Predeſtinatians and Arminians.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The queſtion concerning the ſatisfaction of Chriſt with Socinus. The reaſon why Sacrifices are figures of Chriſt, common to all ſacrifices. Why, and what Sacrifices the Fathers had, what the Law added. Of our ranſom by the price of Chriſts propitiatory Sacrifice.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Chriſt took away our ſinne by bearing the puniſhment of it. The Propheſie of Eſay LIII. We are reconciled to God by the Goſpel, in conſideration of Chriſts obedience. The reconcilement of Jews and Gentiles, Men and Angels, conſequent to the ſame. Of purging and expiating ſinne by Chriſt, and making propitiation for it. Of Chriſts dying for us.

      * CHAP. XXIX. The grant of Grace, in conſideration of Chriſt, ſuppoſes ſatisfaction made by him for ſinne. Neither our ſinnes imputable to Chriſt, nor his ſufferings to us, formally and perſonally, but, as the meritorious cauſes which ſatisfaction anſwereth. The effect of it, the Covenant of Grace, as well as help to performe it. The Fathers ſaved by the Faith of Chriſt to come. The Goſpel a new Law. The property of Satisfaction and Puniſhment in Chriſts ſufferings. Of the ſenſe of the Catholike Church.

      * CHAP. XXX. God might have reconciled man to himſelf without the coming of Chriſt. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend as well upon his active as paſſive obedience. Chriſt need not ſuffer •ell pa•nes that we might not. The opinion that maketh juſtifying Faith to be truſt in God not true; Yet not prejudiciall to the Faith. The decree of the Council of Trent, and the doctrine of the Schoole; how it is not prejudiciall to the Faith. As alſo that of Socinus.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ſtate of the queſtion concerning the perſeverance of thoſe that are once juſtified. Of three ſenſes, one true, one inconſiſtent with the Faith, the third neither true nor yet deſtructive to the Faith. Evidence from the writings of the Apoſtles. From the Old Teſtament. The grace of Propheſie when it preſuppoſeth ſanctifying grace. Anſwer to ſome Texts, and of S. Pauls meaning in the VII. of the Romans. Of the Polygamy of the Fathers. What aſſurance of Grace Chriſtians may have. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How the fullfilling of Gods Law is poſſible, how impoſſible▪ for a Chriſtian. Of the difference between mortall and v•niall ſinne. What love of God and of our neighbour was neceſſary under the Old Teſtament. Whether the S•rmon in the Mount correct the falſe interpretation of the Jewes, or inhanſe the obligation of the Law. Of the difference between matter of Precept and matter of Counſail; and the Perfection of Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Whether any workes of Chriſtians be ſatisfactory for ſinne, and meritorious of heaven, or not. The recovery of Gods grace for a Chriſtian fallen from it, a work of labour and time. The neceſſity and efficacy of Penance to that purpoſe, according to the Scriptures, and the practiſe of the Church. Merit by virtue of Gods promiſe, neceſſary. The Catholicke Church agrees in it, the preſent Church of Rome allowes merit of juſtice▪

      * CHAP. I. The Society of the Church founded upon the duty of communicating in the Offices of Gods Service. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt, among thoſe Offices, proper to Chriſtianity. What opinions, concerning the preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood in the Euchariſt, are on foot.

      * CHAP. II. That the natural ſubſtance of the Elements remains in the Sacrament. That the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is nevertheleſſe preſent in the ſame, when it is received, not by the receiving of it. The eating of the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe neceſſarily requireth the ſame. This cauſes no contradiction nor improperty in the words of our Lord.

      * CHAP. III. That the preſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt depends not upon the living Faith of him that receives, but upon the true profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the Church that celebrates. The Scriptures that are alleged for the dependence of it upon the communication of the properties. They conclude not the ſenſe of them by whom they are alleged. How the Scripture confineth the fleſh of Chriſt to the Heavens.

      * CHAP. IV. The opinion which maketh the Conſecration to be done by rehearſing the operative words. That our Lord conſecrated by Thanksgiving. The Form of it in all Liturgies, together with the conſent of the Fathers. Evidence, that there is no Tradition of the Church for the aboliſhing of the Elements.

      * CHAP. V. It cannot be proved by the Old Teſtament that the Euchariſt is a Sacrifice. How, by the New Teſtament it may be ſo accounted. Four reaſons thereof, depending upon the nature of Juſtifying Faith premiſed. The conſent of the Catholick Church. The concurrence of the Church of England to the premiſes.

      * CHAP. VI. The reaſon of the Order by which I proceed, brings me to the Baptiſm of Infants in the next place. The power of the Keyes ſeen in granting Baptiſm, as well as in communicating the Euchariſt. Why Socinians make Baptiſm indifferent: Why Antinomians make it a miſtake to Baptize. The grounds upon which I ſhake off both: With anſwer to ſome objections.

      * CHAP. VII. The ground of baptizing Infants Originall ſinne, though not inſtituted till Chriſt roſe again. No other cure for it. Infants of Chriſtians may be Diſciples, are holy. The effect of Circumciſion under the Law, inferreth the effect of Baptiſm under the Goſpel.

      * CHAP. VIII. What is alleadged to impeach Tradition for baptizing Infants; Proves not, that any could be ſaved regularly, who dyed unbaptized; but, that, baptizing at yeares was a ſtrong means to make good Chriſtians. Why the Church now Baptize, Infants. What becomes of Infants dying unbaptized, unanſwerable. What thoſe Infants g•t who dye baptized.

      * CHAP. IX. What controverſie the Reformation hath with the Church of Rome about Penance. Inward repentance that is ſincere, obtaineth pardon alone. Remiſſion of ſinnes by the Goſpel onely: The condition of it by the Miniſtrey of the Church. What the power of binding and looſing contains more then Preaching, or taking away offenſes. Sinne may be pardoned without the uſe of it. Wherein the neceſſity of uſing it lyeth.

      * CHAP. X. The Sects of the Montaniſts, Novations, Donatiſts, and Meletians, evidence the cure of ſinne by Penance, to be a Tradition of the Apoſtles. So doth the agreement of primitive practice with their writings. Indulgence of regular Penance from the Apoſtles. Confeſſion of ſecret ſinnes in the Primitive Church. That no ſinne can be cured without the Keyes of the Church, there is no Tradition from the Apoſtles. The neceſſity of confeſſing ſecret ſinnes, whereupon it ſtands.

      * CHAP. IX. Penance is not required to redeem tho debt of temporall puniſhment when the ſinne is pardoned. What aſſurance of forgiveneſſe, the law of auricular Confeſſion, as it is uſed in the Church of Rome, procureth Of injoyning Penance, after abſolution performed. Setting aſide abuſes, the Law is agreeable to Gods. Of the order taken by the Church of England.

      * CHAP. XI. The Unction of the ſick pretendeth onely bodily health, upon ſuppoſition of the cure of ſinne by the Keyes of the Church. Objections anſwered. The Tradition of the Church evidenceth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XII. The ground of the Right of the Church in Matrimonial cauſes. Mariage of one with one inſolubly is a Law of Chriſtianity; The Law of Moſes not injoyning it. The Law of the Empire not aiming at the ground of it. Evidence from the primitive practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XIV. Scripture alleged to prove the bond of Mariage inſoluble in caſe of adultery, uneffectuall. S. Paul and our Lord ſpeak both to one purpoſe, according to S. Jerome, and S. Auſtine. The contrary opinion more reaſonable, and more general in the Church. Why the Church may reſtrain the innocent party from marying again. The Imperial Lawes could never be of force to void the Power of the Church. Evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIV. Another opinion, admitting the ground of lawfull Impediments. What Impediments ariſe upon the Conſtitution of the Church, generally as a Society, or particularly, as of Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XVI. Of the Power of making Gouernours and Miniſters of the Church. Upon what ground the Hierarchy of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons ſtandeth, in oppoſition to Presbyteries and Congregations. Of the Power of Confirming, and the evidence of the Hierarchy which it yieldeth. Of thoſe Scriptures which ſeem to ſpeak of Presbyteries or Congregations.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power given the XII. under the Title of Apoſtles, and the LXX. Diſciples. That the VII were Deacons. Of the firſt Presbyters at Jeruſalem, and the Intereſt of the People. Presbyters appropriated to Churches, under the Apoſtles. S. Pauls Deacons no Presbyters. No ground for Lay Flders.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The Apoſtles all of oequall power; S. Peter onely chiefe in managing it. The ground for the pre-•minence of Churches, before and over Churches. Of Alexandria, Antiochia, Jeruſalem and Rome. Ground for the pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, before all Churches. The conſequence of that Ground. A ſummary of the evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIX. Of the proceedings about Marcion and Montanus at Rome. The buſineſse of Pope Victor about keeping Eaſter; a peremptory inſtance. The buſineſſe of the Novatians evidenceth the ſame. Of the buſineſſes concerning the rebaptizing of Hereticks, Dionyſius of Alexandria, Paulus Samoſatenus, S. Cypriane, and, of the Donatiſts under Conſtantine.

      * CHAP. XX. Of the conſtitution and authority of Councils. The ground of the pre-eminences of Churches in the Romane Empire. The VI. Canon of the Council of Nicaea. The pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, and that of Conſtantinople. Some inſtances againſt the ſuperiority of Biſhops, out of the records of the Church; what offices every Order by Gods Law, or by Canon Law, miniſtreth.

      * CHAP. XXI. Of the times of God ſervice; By what Title of his Law the firſt day of the week is kept Holy. How the Sabbath is to be ſanctified by Moſes Law. The fourth Commandment, the ground upon which the Apoſtles inacted it. Ʋpon what ground the Church limiteth the times of Gods ſervice. Of Eaſter, and the Lent Faſt afore it. Of the difference of meats, and meaſure of Faſting. Of the keeping o four Lords Birthday, and other Feſtivals, and the regular hours of the day for Gods ſervice.

      * CHAP. XXII. The people of God •ied to build Synagogues, though not by the leter of the Law. The Church to provide Churches, though the Scripture command it not. Preſcribing the form of Gods publick ſervice, is not quenching the Spirit. The Pſalter is preſcribed the Church for Gods Praiſes. The Scriptures preſcribed to be read in the Church; The Order of reading them to be preſcribed by the Church.

      * CHAP. XXIII. The conſideration of the Euchariſt preſcribed by Tradition, for the mater of it. Lords Prayer preſcribed in all ſervices. The mater of Prayers for all eſtates preſcribed. The form of Baptiſm neceſſary to be preſcribed. The ſame reaſon holdeth in the forms of other Offices.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The Soules of the Fathers were not in the Devils Power till Chriſt; Though the Old Teſtament declare not their eſtate. Of Samuels ſoul. The ſoul of our Lord Chriſt, parting from his body, went with the Thiefe to Paradiſe. Of his triumph over the powers of darkneſſe.

Of the equivocation of the word Sacrament, in the Fathers. The reaſon of a Sacrament in Baptiſme and the Euchariſt. In extreme Ʋnction. In Marriage. In Confirmation, Ordination, and Penance.

      * CHAP. XXX. To worſhip Chriſt in the Euchariſt, though believing tranſubstantiation, is not Idolatry. Ground for the honour of Saints and Martyrs. The Saints and the Angels pray for us. Three ſorts of prayers to Saints: The firſt, agreeable with Chriſtianity: The laſt may be Idolatry: The ſecond a ſtep to it. Of the Reliques of the Saints Bodies. What the ſecond Commandement prohibiteth or alloweth. The ſecond Councile of Nicea doth not decree Idolatry; And yet there is no decree in the Church for the worſhiping of Images.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ground for a Monaſticall life in the Scriptures; And in the practice of the primitive Church. The Church getteth no peculiar intereſt in them who profeſſe it, by their profeſſing of it. The nature and intent of it renders it ſubordinate to the Clergy. How farre the ſingle life of the Clergy hath been a Law to the Church. Inexecution of the Canons for it. Nullity of the proceeddings of the Church of Rome in it. The intereſt of the People in the acts of the Church; And in the uſe of the Scriptures.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How great the Power of the Church, and the effect of it is. The right of judging the cauſes of Chriſtians c•aſeth, when it is protected by the State. An Objection; If Eccl•ſiaſticall Power were from God, Secular Power could not limit the uſe of it. Ground for the Intereſt of the State in Church matters. The inconſequence of the argument. The concurrence of both Intereſts to the Law of the Church. The Intereſt of the State in the indowment of the Church. Concurrence of both in matrimoniall cauſes, and Ordinations. Temporall penalties upon Excommunication from the State. No Soveraigne ſubject to the greater Excommunication, but to the leſſe. The Rights of the Jewes State and of Chriſtian Powers, in Religion, partly the ſame, partly not. The infinite Power of the Pope not founded upon acts of Epiſcopacy, but upon the Secular Powers of Chriſtendome.

1. OF THE COVENANT OF GRACE.

    _ The Firſt BOOK.

      * CHAP. I. All agree, that Reaſon is to decide controverſies of Faith. The objection, that Faith is taught by Gods Spirit, anſwered. What Reaſon decideth queſtions of Faith. The reſolution of Faith ends not in the light of Reaſon, but in that which Reaſon evidenceth to come from Gods meſſengers.

      * CHAP. II. The queſtion between the Scripture and the Church, which of them is Judge in matters of Faith. Whether opinion, the Tradition of the Church ſtands better with. Thoſe that hold the Scripture to be clear in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, have no reaſon to exclude the Tradition of the Church. What opinions they are, that deny the Church to be a Society or Corporation by Gods Law.

      * CHAP. III. That neither the ſentence of the Church, nor the dictate of Gods Spirit, can be the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be received. No man can know that hee hath Gods Spirit, without knowing that hee is a true Chriſtian; Which ſuppoſeth the truth of the Scripture. The motives of Faith are the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be believed: And the conſent of Gods people the reaſon that evidences thoſe motives to be infallibly true. How the Scriptures are believed for themſelves. How a Circle is made in rendering a reaſon of the Faith. The Scriptures are Gods Law to all, to whom they are publiſhed, by Gods act of publiſhing them; But Civil Law, by the act of Soveraign Powers, in acting Chriſtianity upon their Subjects.

      * CHAP. IV. Neither the Dictate of Gods Spirit nor the authority of the Church is the reaſon of believing any thing in Chriſtianity. Whether the Church be before the Scripture, or the Scripture before the Church. The Scriptures contain not the Infallibility of the Church. Nor the conſent of all Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. V. All things neceſſary to ſalvation are not clear in the Scriptures to all underſtandings. Not in the Old Teſtament. Not in the Goſpel. Not in the Writings of the Apoſtles. It is neceſſary to ſalvation to believe more than this, that our Lord is the Chriſt. Time cauſeth obſcurity in the Scriptures, aſwell as in other Records. That it is no where ſaid in the Scriptures, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are clear in the Scriptures. Neither is there any conſent of all Chriſtians to evidence the ſame.

      * CHAP. VI. All interpretation of Scripture is to be confined within the Tradition of the Church. This ſuppoſeth that the Church is a Communion inſtituted by God. What means there is to make evidence of Gods Charter, upon which the Corporation of the Church ſubſiſteth. The name of the Church, in the Scriptures, often ſignifieth the Whole or Cathelick Church.

      * CHAP. VII. That the Apoſtles delivered to the Church a Summary of Chriſtianity, which, all ſhould be baptized were to profeſs. Evidence out of the Scriptures. Evidence out of the Scriptures for Tradition regulating the Communion of the Church, and the Order of it. Evidence for the Rule of Faith, out of the records of the Church. For the Canons of the Church, and the pedegree of them from the Order eſtabliſhed in the Church by the Apoſtles. That the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and that by being baptized, is neceſſary to the ſalvation of a Chriſtian.

      * CHAP. VIII. That the Power of Governing the whole Church was in the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, and thoſe whom they took to aſſiſt them in the parts of it. The Power of their Succeſſors muſt needs be derived from thoſe. Why that Succeſſion which appeares in one Church, neceſſarily holdeth all Churches. The holding of Councils evidenceth the Ʋnity of the Church.

      * CHAP. IX. The Keyes of the Church given the Apoſtles, and exerciſed by Excommunication under the Apoſtles. The ground thereof is that profeſſion, which, all that are baptized are to make. That Penance and abatemeut of Penance hath been in force ever ſince and under the Apoſtles. In particular, of excluding Hereticks.

      * CHAP. X. Evidence of the Apoſtles act from the effect of it, in preſerving the Ʋnity of the Church. Of the buſineſſe of Marcion and Montanus. That about keeping Eaſter. That of the Novations, of rebaptizing Hereticks, of Paulus Samoſatenus, of Dionyſius Alexandrinus, and Arius. Of communicatory leters, and the intercourſe of the Church under and after the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. XI.Ʋpon what grounds the firſt book de Synedriis holds that the Church cannot excommunicate. Before the Law there was no ſuch Power, nor by it. Chriſtians went for Jewes under the Apoſtles. His ſenſe of ſome Scriptures. What the Leviatha• ſaith in general concerning the Power of the Church. Both ſuppoſe that Eccleſiaſtical Power includeth Temporal, which is not true. Of the Oxford Doctors Paraeneſis.

      * CHAP. XII. That the Law experſly covenanted for the Land of Promiſe. A great Objection againſt this, from the Great precept of the Law. The hope of the world to come under the Law, and the obedience which it requireth, was grounded upon reaſon from the true God, the Tradition of the Fathers, and the Doctrine of the Prophets. The Love of God above all by the Law extendeth no further than the precepts of the Law, the love of our Neighbor onely to Jewes. Of the Ceremonial, Judicial and Moral Law.

      * CHAP. XIII. That the Law tendreth no other promiſe but that of the Land of Canaan. How the Reſurrection is ſignified by the Prophets. Expreſſe texts of the Apoſtles. Their arguments, and the arguments of our Lord do ſuppoſe the myſtical ſenſe of the Scriptures. That this ſenſe is to be made good throughout the Scripture, whereſoever the ground of it takes place; Chriſtianity well grounded ſuppoſing this. What parts of Scripture may be queſtionable, whether they have a myſtical ſenſe or not. The ſayings and doings of our Lord have it; As alſo thoſe paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which are fulfilled by the ſame. The ſenſe of the Fathers.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Leviathans opin•on, that Chriſt came to reſtore that kingdome of God which the Jewes caſt off when they rejected Samuel. It overthroweth the foundation of Chriſtianity. The true Government of Gods ancient people. The name of the Church in the New Teſtament cannot ſignifie the Synagogue. Nor any Chriſtian State.

      * CHAP. XV. How the Power of the Church is founded upon the Law. The Power of the Kingdome, Prieſthood, Prophets, and Rulers of that people all of divine right. How farre theſe qualities and the powers of them are to continue in the Church. The ſenſe of the Fathers in this point. That the acts of S. Paul and the reſt of the Apoſtles were not of force by virtue of the Law. What Eccleſiaſtical Power ſhould have been among the Jewes, in caſe they had received the Goſpel, and ſo the State had ſtood.

      * CHAP. XVI. The Church founded upon the Power given the Apoſtles. What is the ſubject mater of Church Lawes. The right of the Church to Tithes and Oblations is not grounded upon the Law, though evidenced by it, and by practice of the Patriarchs. Evidence of the Apoſtles Order in the Scriptures. The Church of Jeruſalem held not community of Goods. The original practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power of Excommunication in the Church is not founded in the Law. What argument there is of it in the Old Teſtament. The allegorical ſenſe thereof is argumentative. It was not neceſſary that the Chriſtians ſhould incurre perſecution for uſing the Power of the Keyes, and not by virtue of the Law.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The difference between S. Pauls anathema and that of the Jewes. It is not neceſſary that the Chriſtians anathema ſhould ſignifie curſing. That the inceſtuous perſon at Corinth was Excommunicated by S. Paul. Juriſdiction of the Church. Telling the Church, binding and looſing, holding him that is bound for a Heathen or a Publicane, ſigniſie the ſame. The coherence of our Lords diſcourſe. Of Excommunication and Indulgence by private perſons in the Ancient Church. That Excommunication and the Power of the Church could not come in force by the voluntary conſent of the firſt Chriſtians. How it may be ſaid to be voluntary. Of the confederacy of the primitive Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XIX. That Power which was in Churches under the Apoſtles, can never be in any Chriſtian Soveraign. The difference between the Church and the Synagogue in that regard. The intereſt of Secular Power in determining maters of Faith preſuppoſeth the Society of the Church, and the act of it. No man can be bound to profeſſe the contrary of that which hee believeth. Every man is bound to profeſſe that Chriſtianity which hee believeth. The Church is the chief Teacher of Chriſtianity through Chriſtendom, as the Soveraign of Civil Peace, thorough his Dominions. Why the Church is to decide maters of Faith rather than the State, neither being infallible.

      * CHAP. XX. The reſt of the Oxford Doctors pretenſe. The Power of binding and looſing ſuppoſeth not onely the Preaching of the Goſpel, but the outward act of Faith. Chriſtians are not at liberty to caſt themſelves into what formes of Churches the Law of Nature alloweth. They are Judges in chief for themſelves in mater of Religion, ſuppoſing the Catholick Church; not otherwiſe. Secular Power cannot puniſh for Religion, but ſuppoſing the act of the Church, nor do any act to inforce Religion, unleſſe the Church determine the mater of it.

      * CHAP. XXI. How the Tradition of the Church limits the interpretation of Scriptures. How the declaration of the Church becomes a reaſonable mark of Hereſie. That which is not found in the Scriptures may have been delivered by the Apoſtles. Some things delivered by the Apoſtles, and recorded in the Scriptures; may not oblige. S. Auſtines Rule of Apoſtolical Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Authority of the Fathers is not grounded upon any preſumption of their Learning or Holineſſe. How farr they challenge the credit of Hiſtorical truth. The pre-eminenee of the Primitive. The preſumption that is grounded upon their ranks and qualities in the Church. Of Arnobius, Lactantius, Tertullian, Origen, Clemens, and the approbation of poſterity.

      * CHAP. XXIII. Two inſtances againſt the premiſes, beſides the objection concerning the beginning of Antichriſt under the Apoſtles. The general anſwer to it. The ſeven Trumpets in the Apocalypſe fore-tell the deſtruction of the Jewes. The ſeven Vials, the plagues inflicted upon the Empire for the ten perſecutions. The correſpondence of Deniels Propheſie inferreth the ſame. Neither S. Pauls Prophe••e nor S. Johns concerneth any Chriſtian. Neither the opinion of the Chiliaſts, nor the giving of the Euchariſt to Infants new Baptized, Catholick.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Two ſorts of means to reſolve whatſoever is reſolvable concerning the Scripture. Upon what terms the Church may, or is to determine controverſies of Faith. And what obligation that determination produceth. Traditions of the Apoſtles oblige the preſent Church, as the reaſons of them continue or not. Inſtances in our Lords Paſſeover and Euchariſt. Penance under the Apoſtles, and afterwards. S. Pauls vail, eating blood, and things offered to Idols. The power of the Church in limiting theſe Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXV. The power of the Church in limiting even the Traditions of the Apoſtles. Not every abuſe of this power, a ſufficient warrant for particular Churches to reforme themſelves. Hereſie conſiſts in denying ſomething, neceſſary to ſalvation to be believed. Schiſm, in departing from the unity of the Church, whether upon that, or any other cauſe. Implicite Faith no virtue; but the effect of it may be the work of Chriſtian charity.

      * CHAP. XXVI. What it is to adde to Gods Law; What to adde the Apocalypſe. S. Pauls Anathema. The Beraeans. S. Johns Goſpel ſufficient to make one believe; and the Scriptures, The man of God perfit. How the Law giveth light, and Chriſtians are taught by God. How Idolatry is ſaid, not to be commanded by God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. Why it was death to tranſgreſs the determinations of the Jews Conſiſtory, and what power this argueth in the Church. A difference between the authority of the Apoſtles, and that of the Church. The being of the Church to the worlds end, with power of the Keyes, makes it not infallible. Obedience to Superiors, and the Pillar of truth inferre it not.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The Fathers acknowledge the Sufficience and clearneſs of the Scriptures, as, the Traditions of the Church. They are to be reconciled, by limiting the terms which they uſe. The limitation of thoſe ſayings which make all Chriſtian truth to be contained in the Scriptures. Of thoſe which make the authority of the Church the ground of Faith.

      * CHAP. XXXII. Anſwer to an Objection, that choice of Religion becomes difficult upon theſe terms. This reſolution is for the Intereſt of the Reformation. Thoſe that make the Church Infallible cannot, thoſe that make the Scripture clear and ſufficient may own Tradition for evidence to determine the meaning of the Scriptures, and Controverſies of Faith. The Intereſt of the Church of England. The pretenſe of Ruſhworthes Dialogues, that wee have no unqueſtionable Scripture, and, that the Tradition of the Church never changes.

      * CHAP. XXXI. That the Scriptures which wee have are unqueſtionable. That miſtakes in Copying are not conſiderable to the ſenſe and effect of them. The meaning of the Hebrew and Greek, even of the Prophets, determinable, to the deciding of Controverſies. How Religion delivered by Tradition becomes ſubject to be corrupted.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. The Diſpute concerning the Canon of Scripture, and the tranſlations thereof, in two Queſtions. There can be no Tradition for thoſe books that were written ſince Propheſie ceaſed. Wherein the excellence of them above other books lies. The chief objections againſt them are queſtionable. In thoſe parcels of the New Teſtament that have been queſtioned, the caſe is not the ſame. The ſenſe of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Onely the Original Copy can be Authentick. But, the truth thereof may as well be found in the tranſlations of the Old Teſtament, as in the Jewes Copies. The Jewes have not falſified them of malice. The Points come neither from Moſes, nor Eſdras, but from the Talmud Jewes.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. Of the anci•n eſt Tranſlations of the Bible into Greek firſt; With the Authors and authority of the ſame; Then into the Chaldee, Syriack, and Latine. Exceptions againſt the Greek, and the Samaritane Pentateuch. They are helps nevertheleſs to aſſure the true reading of the Scriptures, though with other Copies; whether Jewiſh or Chriſtian. Though the Vulgar Latine were better than the preſent Greek, yet muſt both depend upon the Original Greek of the New Teſta•ent. No danger to Chriſtianity by the differences remaining in the Bible.

      * CHAP. 1. Two parts of that which remains. How the diſpute concerning the Holy Trinity with Socinus belongs to the firſt. The Queſtion of juſtification by Faith alone. The Opinion of Socinus concerning the whole Covenant of Grace. The opinion of thoſe who make juſtifying Faith the knowledge of a mans Predeſtination, oppoſite to it in the other extream. The difference between it and that of the Antinomians. That there are mean Opinions.

      * CHAP. II. Evidence what is the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. The contract of Baptiſm. The promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt annexed to Chriſts, not to Johns Baptiſm. Thoſe are made Chriſts Diſciples as Chriſtians that take up his Croſſe in Baptiſm. The effects of Baptiſm according to the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. III. The exhortations of the Apoſtles, that are drawn from the patterns of the Old Teſtament, ſuppoſe the ſame. How the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament are the ſame, how not the ſame. How the New Teſtament and the New Covenant are both one. The free-will of man acteth the ſame part in dealing about the New-Covenant, as about the Old. The Gospel a Law.

      * CHAP. IV. The conſent of the whole Church evidenced by the cuſtome of chatechiſing. By the opinion thereof concerning the ſalvation of thoſe that delayed their Baptiſm. By the rites and Ceremonies of Baptiſm. Why no penance for ſins before, but after Baptiſm. The doctrine of the Church of England evident in this caſe.

      * CHAP. V. The Preaching of our Lord and his Apoſtles evidenceth, that ſome act of Mans free choice is the condition which it requireth. The correspondence betwen the Old and New Teſtament inferreth the ſame. So do the errors of Socinians and Antinomians concerning the neceſſity of Baptiſm. Objections deferred.

      * CHAP. VI. Juſtifying Faith ſometimes conſiſts in believing the truth. Sometimes, in truſt in God grounded upon the truth. Somtimes in Chriſtianity, that is in imbracing and profeſſing it. And that in the Fathers as well as in the Scriptures. Of the informed and formed Faith of the Schools.

      * CHAP. VII. The laſt ſignification of Faith is properly justifying Faith. The firſt by a Metonymy of the cauſe: The ſecond of the effect. Thoſe that are not juſtified doe truly believe. The truſt of a Chriſtian preſuppoſeth him to be juſtified. All the promiſes of the Goſpel become due at once by the Covenant of Grace. That, to believe that we are Elect or Juſtified, is not Justifying Faith.

      * CHAP. VIII. The objection from S. Paul; We are not juſtified by the Law nor by Workes, but by Grace and by Faith. Not meant of the Goſpel, and the workes that ſuppoſe it. The queſtion that S. Paul ſpeakes to, is of the Law of Moſes and the Workes of it. He ſets thoſe workes in the ſame rank with the workes of the Gentils by the light of nature. The civil and outward workes of the Law may be done by Gentiles. How the Law is a Pedagogue to Chriſt.

      * CHAP. IX. Of the Faith and Juſtification of Abraham and the Patriarkes, according to the Apoſtles. Of the Prophets and righteous men under the Law. Abraham and Rahab the harlot juſtified by workes, if juſtified by Faith. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend upon works which the Goſpell injoyneth. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. X. What Pelagius queſtioneth concerning the Grace of Chriſt, what Socinus further of the ſtate of Chriſt before his birth. The oppoſition between the firſt and ſecond Adam in S. Paul, evidenceth originall ſinne. Coucupiſcence in the unregenerate, and the inability of the Law to ſubdue it, evict the ſame. The ſecond birth by the holy Ghoſt evidenceth that the first birth propagateth ſinne.

      * CHAP. X. The Old Teſtament chargeth all men as well as the wicked to be ſinfull from the wombe. David complaineth of himſelfe as born in ſinne, no leſſe then the Wiſe man of the children of the Gentiles. How Leviticall Lawes argue the ſame. And temporall death under the Old Teſtament. The book of Wiſdome and the Greek Bible.

      * CHAP. XII. The Haereſie of Simon Magus the beginning of the Gnoſticks. That they were in being during the Apoſtles time. Where and when the Haereſie of Cerinthus prevailed, and, that they were Gnoſticks. The beginning of the Encratites under the Apostles. It is evident that one God in Trinity was then glorified among the Christians, by the Fullneſſe of the Godhead which they introduced in ſtead of it.

      * CHAP. XIII. The Word was at the beginning of all things. The apparitions of the Old Teſtament Prefaces to the Incarnation of Chriſt. Ambaſſadors are not honoured with the honour due to their Maſters. The Word of God that was afterwards incarnate was in thoſe Angels that ſpoke in Gods Name. No Angel honoured as God under the New Teſtament. The Word was with God at the beginning of all things, as after his return.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Name of God not aſcribed to Chriſt for the like reaſon as to creatures. The reaſons why the Socinians worſhip Chriſt as God do confute their limitations. Chriſt not God by virtue of his riſing againe. He is the Great God with S. Paul, the true God, with S. John, the onely Lord, with S. Jude. Other Scriptures. Of the forme of God, and of a ſervant in S. Paul.

      * CHAP. XV. Not onely the Church but the World was made by Chriſt. The Word was made fleſh in oppoſition to the Spirit. How the Prophets, how Chriſtians, by receiving the Word of God, are poſſeſſed by his Spirit. How the title of Sonne of God importeth the Godhead. How Chriſt is the brightneſſe and Image of God.

      * CHAP. XVI. The teſtimonies of Chriſts Godhead in the Old Teſtament are firſt underſtood of the figures of Chriſt. Of the Wiſdome of God in Solomon and elſewhere. Of the writings of the Jewes as well before as after Chriſt.

      * CHAP. XVII. Anſwer to thoſe texts of Scripture that ſeem to abate the true Godhead in Chriſt. Of that creature whereof Chriſt is the firſt-borne, and that which the Wiſdome of God made. That this beliefe is the originall Tradition of the Church. What meanes this diſpute furniſheth us with againſt the Arrians. That it is reaſon to ſubmit to revelation concerning the nature of God. The uſe of reaſon is no way renounced by holding this Faith.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The neceſſity of the grace of Chriſt, is the evidence of originall ſinne. How the exaltation of our Lord depends upon his humiliation, and the grace of Christ upon that▪ All the work of Chriſtianity is aſcribed to the grace of Chriſt. Gods predeſtination manifeſteth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XIX. Evidences of the ſame in the Old Teſtament; Of Gods help in getting the Land of Promiſe, and renewing the Covenant: And that for Chriſts ſake. That Chriſtianity cannot ſtand without acknowledging the grace of Chriſt. The Tradition of the Church; In the Baptiſme of Infants: In the Prayers of the Church; In the decrees against Pelagius and other records of the Church.

      * CHAP. XX. Wherein Originall ſinne conſiſteth; What opinions are on foot. That it is not Adams ſinne imputed to his poſterity. Whether man were at the firſt created to a ſupernaturall end, or not. An eſtate of meer nature, but innocent, poſſible. Originall ſinne is Concupiſcence. How Baptiſme voids it. Concerning the late novelty in the Church of England about Originall ſinne.

      * CHAP. XXI. The opinion that mak•s the Predetermination of mans will by God the ſourſe of his freedom; And wherein Janſenius differs from it. Of neceſsity upon ſuppoſition & abſolute. The neceſsity of the Will following the last dictate of the underſtanding is onely upon ſuppoſition, As alſo that which Gods foreſight creates. The difference between indifferent and undetermined.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Goſpel findeth man free from neceſſity, though not from bondage. Of the Antecedent and Conſequent Will of God. Praedetermination not the root, but the rooting up of Freedome and of Chriſtianity. Againſt the opinion of Janſenius.

      * CHAP. XXIII. A man is able to doe things truely honeſt under Originall ſin. But not to make God the end of all his doings. How all the actions of the Gentiles are ſins. They are accountable onely for the Law of nature. How all men have or have not Grace ſufficient to ſave.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Though God determineth not the will immediately, yet he determineth the effect thereof by the meanes of his providence, preſenting the object ſo as he foreſees it will chuſe, The caſes of Pharoah, of Solomon, of Ahab, and of the Jewes that crucified Chriſt. Of Gods foreknowledg of future conditionalls that come not to paſſe. The ground of foreknowledg of future contingencies. Difficult objections anſwered.

      * CHAP. XXV. The grounds of the difference between ſufficient and effectuall. How naturall occaſions, conduce to ſupernaturall actions, The inſufficience of Janſenius his doctrine. Of ſufficient grace under the Law of Moſes and Nature.

      * CHAP. XXVI. Predeſtination to grace abſolute, to glory reſpective: Purpoſe of denying effectuall Grace abſolute, of puniſhing reſpective. The end, to which God predeſtinates, is not the end for which he predeſtinates. Grace the reward of the right uſe of Grace. How much of the queſtion the Goſpell determines not. That our indeavours are ingaged no leſſe, then if predeſtination were not, it determineth. Of the Tradition of the Church; and of Semipelagians, Predeſtinatians and Arminians.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The queſtion concerning the ſatisfaction of Chriſt with Socinus. The reaſon why Sacrifices are figures of Chriſt, common to all ſacrifices. Why, and what Sacrifices the Fathers had, what the Law added. Of our ranſom by the price of Chriſts propitiatory Sacrifice.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Chriſt took away our ſinne by bearing the puniſhment of it. The Propheſie of Eſay LIII. We are reconciled to God by the Goſpel, in conſideration of Chriſts obedience. The reconcilement of Jews and Gentiles, Men and Angels, conſequent to the ſame. Of purging and expiating ſinne by Chriſt, and making propitiation for it. Of Chriſts dying for us.

      * CHAP. XXIX. The grant of Grace, in conſideration of Chriſt, ſuppoſes ſatisfaction made by him for ſinne. Neither our ſinnes imputable to Chriſt, nor his ſufferings to us, formally and perſonally, but, as the meritorious cauſes which ſatisfaction anſwereth. The effect of it, the Covenant of Grace, as well as help to performe it. The Fathers ſaved by the Faith of Chriſt to come. The Goſpel a new Law. The property of Satisfaction and Puniſhment in Chriſts ſufferings. Of the ſenſe of the Catholike Church.

      * CHAP. XXX. God might have reconciled man to himſelf without the coming of Chriſt. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend as well upon his active as paſſive obedience. Chriſt need not ſuffer •ell pa•nes that we might not. The opinion that maketh juſtifying Faith to be truſt in God not true; Yet not prejudiciall to the Faith. The decree of the Council of Trent, and the doctrine of the Schoole; how it is not prejudiciall to the Faith. As alſo that of Socinus.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ſtate of the queſtion concerning the perſeverance of thoſe that are once juſtified. Of three ſenſes, one true, one inconſiſtent with the Faith, the third neither true nor yet deſtructive to the Faith. Evidence from the writings of the Apoſtles. From the Old Teſtament. The grace of Propheſie when it preſuppoſeth ſanctifying grace. Anſwer to ſome Texts, and of S. Pauls meaning in the VII. of the Romans. Of the Polygamy of the Fathers. What aſſurance of Grace Chriſtians may have. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How the fullfilling of Gods Law is poſſible, how impoſſible▪ for a Chriſtian. Of the difference between mortall and v•niall ſinne. What love of God and of our neighbour was neceſſary under the Old Teſtament. Whether the S•rmon in the Mount correct the falſe interpretation of the Jewes, or inhanſe the obligation of the Law. Of the difference between matter of Precept and matter of Counſail; and the Perfection of Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Whether any workes of Chriſtians be ſatisfactory for ſinne, and meritorious of heaven, or not. The recovery of Gods grace for a Chriſtian fallen from it, a work of labour and time. The neceſſity and efficacy of Penance to that purpoſe, according to the Scriptures, and the practiſe of the Church. Merit by virtue of Gods promiſe, neceſſary. The Catholicke Church agrees in it, the preſent Church of Rome allowes merit of juſtice▪

      * CHAP. I. The Society of the Church founded upon the duty of communicating in the Offices of Gods Service. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt, among thoſe Offices, proper to Chriſtianity. What opinions, concerning the preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood in the Euchariſt, are on foot.

      * CHAP. II. That the natural ſubſtance of the Elements remains in the Sacrament. That the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is nevertheleſſe preſent in the ſame, when it is received, not by the receiving of it. The eating of the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe neceſſarily requireth the ſame. This cauſes no contradiction nor improperty in the words of our Lord.

      * CHAP. III. That the preſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt depends not upon the living Faith of him that receives, but upon the true profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the Church that celebrates. The Scriptures that are alleged for the dependence of it upon the communication of the properties. They conclude not the ſenſe of them by whom they are alleged. How the Scripture confineth the fleſh of Chriſt to the Heavens.

      * CHAP. IV. The opinion which maketh the Conſecration to be done by rehearſing the operative words. That our Lord conſecrated by Thanksgiving. The Form of it in all Liturgies, together with the conſent of the Fathers. Evidence, that there is no Tradition of the Church for the aboliſhing of the Elements.

      * CHAP. V. It cannot be proved by the Old Teſtament that the Euchariſt is a Sacrifice. How, by the New Teſtament it may be ſo accounted. Four reaſons thereof, depending upon the nature of Juſtifying Faith premiſed. The conſent of the Catholick Church. The concurrence of the Church of England to the premiſes.

      * CHAP. VI. The reaſon of the Order by which I proceed, brings me to the Baptiſm of Infants in the next place. The power of the Keyes ſeen in granting Baptiſm, as well as in communicating the Euchariſt. Why Socinians make Baptiſm indifferent: Why Antinomians make it a miſtake to Baptize. The grounds upon which I ſhake off both: With anſwer to ſome objections.

      * CHAP. VII. The ground of baptizing Infants Originall ſinne, though not inſtituted till Chriſt roſe again. No other cure for it. Infants of Chriſtians may be Diſciples, are holy. The effect of Circumciſion under the Law, inferreth the effect of Baptiſm under the Goſpel.

      * CHAP. VIII. What is alleadged to impeach Tradition for baptizing Infants; Proves not, that any could be ſaved regularly, who dyed unbaptized; but, that, baptizing at yeares was a ſtrong means to make good Chriſtians. Why the Church now Baptize, Infants. What becomes of Infants dying unbaptized, unanſwerable. What thoſe Infants g•t who dye baptized.

      * CHAP. IX. What controverſie the Reformation hath with the Church of Rome about Penance. Inward repentance that is ſincere, obtaineth pardon alone. Remiſſion of ſinnes by the Goſpel onely: The condition of it by the Miniſtrey of the Church. What the power of binding and looſing contains more then Preaching, or taking away offenſes. Sinne may be pardoned without the uſe of it. Wherein the neceſſity of uſing it lyeth.

      * CHAP. X. The Sects of the Montaniſts, Novations, Donatiſts, and Meletians, evidence the cure of ſinne by Penance, to be a Tradition of the Apoſtles. So doth the agreement of primitive practice with their writings. Indulgence of regular Penance from the Apoſtles. Confeſſion of ſecret ſinnes in the Primitive Church. That no ſinne can be cured without the Keyes of the Church, there is no Tradition from the Apoſtles. The neceſſity of confeſſing ſecret ſinnes, whereupon it ſtands.

      * CHAP. IX. Penance is not required to redeem tho debt of temporall puniſhment when the ſinne is pardoned. What aſſurance of forgiveneſſe, the law of auricular Confeſſion, as it is uſed in the Church of Rome, procureth Of injoyning Penance, after abſolution performed. Setting aſide abuſes, the Law is agreeable to Gods. Of the order taken by the Church of England.

      * CHAP. XI. The Unction of the ſick pretendeth onely bodily health, upon ſuppoſition of the cure of ſinne by the Keyes of the Church. Objections anſwered. The Tradition of the Church evidenceth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XII. The ground of the Right of the Church in Matrimonial cauſes. Mariage of one with one inſolubly is a Law of Chriſtianity; The Law of Moſes not injoyning it. The Law of the Empire not aiming at the ground of it. Evidence from the primitive practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XIV. Scripture alleged to prove the bond of Mariage inſoluble in caſe of adultery, uneffectuall. S. Paul and our Lord ſpeak both to one purpoſe, according to S. Jerome, and S. Auſtine. The contrary opinion more reaſonable, and more general in the Church. Why the Church may reſtrain the innocent party from marying again. The Imperial Lawes could never be of force to void the Power of the Church. Evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIV. Another opinion, admitting the ground of lawfull Impediments. What Impediments ariſe upon the Conſtitution of the Church, generally as a Society, or particularly, as of Chriſtians. By what Law ſome degrees are prohibited Chriſtians. And, of the Polygamy of the Patriarchs. Mariage with the deceaſed wives Siſter, and with a Couſin Germane, by what Law prohibited.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power given the XII. under the Title of Apoſtles, and the LXX. Diſciples. That the VII were Deacons. Of the firſt Presbyters at Jeruſalem, and the Intereſt of the People. Presbyters appropriated to Churches, under the Apoſtles. S. Pauls Deacons no Presbyters. No ground for Lay Flders.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The Apoſtles all of oequall power; S. Peter onely chiefe in managing it. The ground for the pre-•minence of Churches, before and over Churches. Of Alexandria, Antiochia, Jeruſalem and Rome. Ground for the pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, before all Churches. The conſequence of that Ground. A ſummary of the evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIX. Of the proceedings about Marcion and Montanus at Rome. The buſineſse of Pope Victor about keeping Eaſter; a peremptory inſtance. The buſineſſe of the Novatians evidenceth the ſame. Of the buſineſſes concerning the rebaptizing of Hereticks, Dionyſius of Alexandria, Paulus Samoſatenus, S. Cypriane, and, of the Donatiſts under Conſtantine.

      * CHAP. XX. Of the conſtitution and authority of Councils. The ground of the pre-eminences of Churches in the Romane Empire. The VI. Canon of the Council of Nicaea. The pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, and that of Conſtantinople. Some inſtances againſt the ſuperiority of Biſhops, out of the records of the Church; what offices every Order by Gods Law, or by Canon Law, miniſtreth.

      * CHAP. XXI. Of the times of God ſervice; By what Title of his Law the firſt day of the week is kept Holy. How the Sabbath is to be ſanctified by Moſes Law.

Of the difference of meats, and meaſure of Faſting. Of the keeping o four Lords Birthday, and other Feſtivals, and the regular hours of the day for Gods ſervice.

      * CHAP. XXII. The people of God •ied to build Synagogues, though not by the leter of the Law. The Church to provide Churches, though the Scripture command it not. Preſcribing the form of Gods publick ſervice, is not quenching the Spirit. The Pſalter is preſcribed the Church for Gods Praiſes. The Scriptures preſcribed to be read in the Church; The Order of reading them to be preſcribed by the Church.

      * CHAP. XXIII. The conſideration of the Euchariſt preſcribed by Tradition, for the mater of it. Lords Prayer preſcribed in all ſervices. The mater of Prayers for all eſtates preſcribed. The form of Baptiſm neceſſary to be preſcribed. The ſame reaſon holdeth in the forms of other Offices.

      * CHAP. XXIV. The Service of God to be preſcribed in a known Language. No pretenſe that the Latine is now underſtood. The means to preſerve Unity in the Church, notwithſtanding. The true reaſon of a Sacrifice inforceth Communion in the Euchariſt. What occaſions may diſpenſe in it. Communion in both kindes commanded the People. Objections anſwered. Who is chargeable with the abuſe.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Prayer the more principall Office of Gods ſervice then Preaching. Preachings, neither Gods word, nor the meanes of ſalvation, unleſſe limited to the Faith of Gods Church. What, the edification of the Church by preaching further requires. The Order for Divine ſervice according to the courſe of the Church of England; According to the cuſtome of the univerſall Church.

      * CHAP. XXV. Idolatry preſuppoſeth an immagination that there is more Gods then one. Objections out of the ſcripture that it is the worſhip of a true God under an Image. the Originall of worſhipping the elements of the world: The Devil: And Images. Of the Idolatry of the Magicians, and of the Gnosticks. What Idolatry the caſes of Aron and of Jer•boam involve. Of the Idolatries practiſed under the Kings and Judges, in anſwer to objections.

      * CHAP. XXVI. The Place, or rather the State of happy and miſerable Soules otherwiſe underſtood by Gods people before Chriſts aſcenſion, then after it. What the Apocalypſe, what the reſt of the Apoſtles declare. Onely Martyrs before Gods Throne. Of the ſight of God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The Soules of the Fathers were not in the Devils Power till Chriſt; Though the Old Teſtament declare not their eſtate. Of Samuels ſoul. The ſoul of our Lord Chriſt, parting from his body, went with the Thiefe to Paradiſe. Of his triumph over the powers of darkneſſe. Prayer for the dead ſignifieth no delivering of ſoules out of Purgatory. The Covenant of Grace requires imperfect happineſſe before the generall judgement. Of forgiveneſſe in the world to come, and, paying the utmoſt farthing.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Ancient opinions in the Church, of the place of ſoules before the day of judgement. No Tradition that the Fathers were in the Ʋerge of Hell, under the Earth. The reaſon of the difference in the expreſſions of the Fathers of the Church. What Tradition of the Church for the place of Christs ſoule, during his death, The Saints ſoules in ſecret manſions, according to the Tradition of the Church. Prayer for the dead ſuppoſeth the ſame.

Three ſorts of prayers to Saints: The firſt, agreeable with Chriſtianity: The laſt may be Idolatry: The ſecond a ſtep to it. Of the Reliques of the Saints Bodies. What the ſecond Commandement prohibiteth or alloweth. The ſecond Councile of Nicea doth not decree Idolatry; And yet there is no decree in the Church for the worſhiping of Images.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ground for a Monaſticall life in the Scriptures; And in the practice of the primitive Church. The Church getteth no peculiar intereſt in them who profeſſe it, by their profeſſing of it. The nature and intent of it renders it ſubordinate to the Clergy. How farre the ſingle life of the Clergy hath been a Law to the Church. Inexecution of the Canons for it. Nullity of the proceeddings of the Church of Rome in it. The intereſt of the People in the acts of the Church; And in the uſe of the Scriptures.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How great the Power of the Church, and the effect of it is. The right of judging the cauſes of Chriſtians c•aſeth, when it is protected by the State. An Objection; If Eccl•ſiaſticall Power were from God, Secular Power could not limit the uſe of it. Ground for the Intereſt of the State in Church matters. The inconſequence of the argument. The concurrence of both Intereſts to the Law of the Church. The Intereſt of the State in the indowment of the Church. Concurrence of both in matrimoniall cauſes, and Ordinations.

The infinite Power of the Pope not founded upon acts of Epiſcopacy, but upon the Secular Powers of Chriſtendome.

    _ The ſecond BOOK.

      * CHAP. I. All agree, that Reaſon is to decide controverſies of Faith. The objection, that Faith is taught by Gods Spirit, anſwered. What Reaſon decideth queſtions of Faith. The reſolution of Faith ends not in the light of Reaſon, but in that which Reaſon evidenceth to come from Gods meſſengers.

      * CHAP. II. The queſtion between the Scripture and the Church, which of them is Judge in matters of Faith. Whether opinion, the Tradition of the Church ſtands better with. Thoſe that hold the Scripture to be clear in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, have no reaſon to exclude the Tradition of the Church. What opinions they are, that deny the Church to be a Society or Corporation by Gods Law.

      * CHAP. III. That neither the ſentence of the Church, nor the dictate of Gods Spirit, can be the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be received. No man can know that hee hath Gods Spirit, without knowing that hee is a true Chriſtian; Which ſuppoſeth the truth of the Scripture. The motives of Faith are the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be believed: And the conſent of Gods people the reaſon that evidences thoſe motives to be infallibly true. How the Scriptures are believed for themſelves. How a Circle is made in rendering a reaſon of the Faith. The Scriptures are Gods Law to all, to whom they are publiſhed, by Gods act of publiſhing them; But Civil Law, by the act of Soveraign Powers, in acting Chriſtianity upon their Subjects.

      * CHAP. IV. Neither the Dictate of Gods Spirit nor the authority of the Church is the reaſon of believing any thing in Chriſtianity. Whether the Church be before the Scripture, or the Scripture before the Church. The Scriptures contain not the Infallibility of the Church. Nor the conſent of all Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. V. All things neceſſary to ſalvation are not clear in the Scriptures to all underſtandings. Not in the Old Teſtament. Not in the Goſpel. Not in the Writings of the Apoſtles. It is neceſſary to ſalvation to believe more than this, that our Lord is the Chriſt. Time cauſeth obſcurity in the Scriptures, aſwell as in other Records. That it is no where ſaid in the Scriptures, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are clear in the Scriptures. Neither is there any conſent of all Chriſtians to evidence the ſame.

      * CHAP. VI. All interpretation of Scripture is to be confined within the Tradition of the Church. This ſuppoſeth that the Church is a Communion inſtituted by God. What means there is to make evidence of Gods Charter, upon which the Corporation of the Church ſubſiſteth. The name of the Church, in the Scriptures, often ſignifieth the Whole or Cathelick Church.

      * CHAP. VII. That the Apoſtles delivered to the Church a Summary of Chriſtianity, which, all ſhould be baptized were to profeſs. Evidence out of the Scriptures. Evidence out of the Scriptures for Tradition regulating the Communion of the Church, and the Order of it. Evidence for the Rule of Faith, out of the records of the Church. For the Canons of the Church, and the pedegree of them from the Order eſtabliſhed in the Church by the Apoſtles. That the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and that by being baptized, is neceſſary to the ſalvation of a Chriſtian.

      * CHAP. VIII. That the Power of Governing the whole Church was in the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, and thoſe whom they took to aſſiſt them in the parts of it. The Power of their Succeſſors muſt needs be derived from thoſe. Why that Succeſſion which appeares in one Church, neceſſarily holdeth all Churches. The holding of Councils evidenceth the Ʋnity of the Church.

      * CHAP. IX. The Keyes of the Church given the Apoſtles, and exerciſed by Excommunication under the Apoſtles. The ground thereof is that profeſſion, which, all that are baptized are to make. That Penance and abatemeut of Penance hath been in force ever ſince and under the Apoſtles. In particular, of excluding Hereticks.

      * CHAP. X. Evidence of the Apoſtles act from the effect of it, in preſerving the Ʋnity of the Church. Of the buſineſſe of Marcion and Montanus. That about keeping Eaſter. That of the Novations, of rebaptizing Hereticks, of Paulus Samoſatenus, of Dionyſius Alexandrinus, and Arius. Of communicatory leters, and the intercourſe of the Church under and after the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. XI.Ʋpon what grounds the firſt book de Synedriis holds that the Church cannot excommunicate. Before the Law there was no ſuch Power, nor by it. Chriſtians went for Jewes under the Apoſtles. His ſenſe of ſome Scriptures. What the Leviatha• ſaith in general concerning the Power of the Church. Both ſuppoſe that Eccleſiaſtical Power includeth Temporal, which is not true. Of the Oxford Doctors Paraeneſis.

      * CHAP. XII. That the Law experſly covenanted for the Land of Promiſe. A great Objection againſt this, from the Great precept of the Law. The hope of the world to come under the Law, and the obedience which it requireth, was grounded upon reaſon from the true God, the Tradition of the Fathers, and the Doctrine of the Prophets. The Love of God above all by the Law extendeth no further than the precepts of the Law, the love of our Neighbor onely to Jewes. Of the Ceremonial, Judicial and Moral Law.

      * CHAP. XIII. That the Law tendreth no other promiſe but that of the Land of Canaan. How the Reſurrection is ſignified by the Prophets. Expreſſe texts of the Apoſtles. Their arguments, and the arguments of our Lord do ſuppoſe the myſtical ſenſe of the Scriptures. That this ſenſe is to be made good throughout the Scripture, whereſoever the ground of it takes place; Chriſtianity well grounded ſuppoſing this. What parts of Scripture may be queſtionable, whether they have a myſtical ſenſe or not. The ſayings and doings of our Lord have it; As alſo thoſe paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which are fulfilled by the ſame. The ſenſe of the Fathers.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Leviathans opin•on, that Chriſt came to reſtore that kingdome of God which the Jewes caſt off when they rejected Samuel. It overthroweth the foundation of Chriſtianity. The true Government of Gods ancient people. The name of the Church in the New Teſtament cannot ſignifie the Synagogue. Nor any Chriſtian State.

      * CHAP. XV. How the Power of the Church is founded upon the Law. The Power of the Kingdome, Prieſthood, Prophets, and Rulers of that people all of divine right. How farre theſe qualities and the powers of them are to continue in the Church. The ſenſe of the Fathers in this point. That the acts of S. Paul and the reſt of the Apoſtles were not of force by virtue of the Law. What Eccleſiaſtical Power ſhould have been among the Jewes, in caſe they had received the Goſpel, and ſo the State had ſtood.

      * CHAP. XVI. The Church founded upon the Power given the Apoſtles. What is the ſubject mater of Church Lawes. The right of the Church to Tithes and Oblations is not grounded upon the Law, though evidenced by it, and by practice of the Patriarchs. Evidence of the Apoſtles Order in the Scriptures. The Church of Jeruſalem held not community of Goods. The original practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power of Excommunication in the Church is not founded in the Law. What argument there is of it in the Old Teſtament. The allegorical ſenſe thereof is argumentative. It was not neceſſary that the Chriſtians ſhould incurre perſecution for uſing the Power of the Keyes, and not by virtue of the Law.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The difference between S. Pauls anathema and that of the Jewes. It is not neceſſary that the Chriſtians anathema ſhould ſignifie curſing. That the inceſtuous perſon at Corinth was Excommunicated by S. Paul. Juriſdiction of the Church. Telling the Church, binding and looſing, holding him that is bound for a Heathen or a Publicane, ſigniſie the ſame. The coherence of our Lords diſcourſe. Of Excommunication and Indulgence by private perſons in the Ancient Church. That Excommunication and the Power of the Church could not come in force by the voluntary conſent of the firſt Chriſtians. How it may be ſaid to be voluntary. Of the confederacy of the primitive Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XIX. That Power which was in Churches under the Apoſtles, can never be in any Chriſtian Soveraign. The difference between the Church and the Synagogue in that regard. The intereſt of Secular Power in determining maters of Faith preſuppoſeth the Society of the Church, and the act of it. No man can be bound to profeſſe the contrary of that which hee believeth. Every man is bound to profeſſe that Chriſtianity which hee believeth. The Church is the chief Teacher of Chriſtianity through Chriſtendom, as the Soveraign of Civil Peace, thorough his Dominions. Why the Church is to decide maters of Faith rather than the State, neither being infallible.

      * CHAP. XX. The reſt of the Oxford Doctors pretenſe. The Power of binding and looſing ſuppoſeth not onely the Preaching of the Goſpel, but the outward act of Faith. Chriſtians are not at liberty to caſt themſelves into what formes of Churches the Law of Nature alloweth. They are Judges in chief for themſelves in mater of Religion, ſuppoſing the Catholick Church; not otherwiſe. Secular Power cannot puniſh for Religion, but ſuppoſing the act of the Church, nor do any act to inforce Religion, unleſſe the Church determine the mater of it.

      * CHAP. XXI. How the Tradition of the Church limits the interpretation of Scriptures. How the declaration of the Church becomes a reaſonable mark of Hereſie. That which is not found in the Scriptures may have been delivered by the Apoſtles. Some things delivered by the Apoſtles, and recorded in the Scriptures; may not oblige. S. Auſtines Rule of Apoſtolical Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Authority of the Fathers is not grounded upon any preſumption of their Learning or Holineſſe. How farr they challenge the credit of Hiſtorical truth. The pre-eminenee of the Primitive. The preſumption that is grounded upon their ranks and qualities in the Church. Of Arnobius, Lactantius, Tertullian, Origen, Clemens, and the approbation of poſterity.

      * CHAP. XXIII. Two inſtances againſt the premiſes, beſides the objection concerning the beginning of Antichriſt under the Apoſtles. The general anſwer to it. The ſeven Trumpets in the Apocalypſe fore-tell the deſtruction of the Jewes. The ſeven Vials, the plagues inflicted upon the Empire for the ten perſecutions. The correſpondence of Deniels Propheſie inferreth the ſame. Neither S. Pauls Prophe••e nor S. Johns concerneth any Chriſtian. Neither the opinion of the Chiliaſts, nor the giving of the Euchariſt to Infants new Baptized, Catholick.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Two ſorts of means to reſolve whatſoever is reſolvable concerning the Scripture. Upon what terms the Church may, or is to determine controverſies of Faith. And what obligation that determination produceth. Traditions of the Apoſtles oblige the preſent Church, as the reaſons of them continue or not. Inſtances in our Lords Paſſeover and Euchariſt. Penance under the Apoſtles, and afterwards. S. Pauls vail, eating blood, and things offered to Idols. The power of the Church in limiting theſe Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXV. The power of the Church in limiting even the Traditions of the Apoſtles. Not every abuſe of this power, a ſufficient warrant for particular Churches to reforme themſelves. Hereſie conſiſts in denying ſomething, neceſſary to ſalvation to be believed. Schiſm, in departing from the unity of the Church, whether upon that, or any other cauſe. Implicite Faith no virtue; but the effect of it may be the work of Chriſtian charity.

      * CHAP. XXVI. What it is to adde to Gods Law; What to adde the Apocalypſe. S. Pauls Anathema. The Beraeans. S. Johns Goſpel ſufficient to make one believe; and the Scriptures, The man of God perfit. How the Law giveth light, and Chriſtians are taught by God. How Idolatry is ſaid, not to be commanded by God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. Why it was death to tranſgreſs the determinations of the Jews Conſiſtory, and what power this argueth in the Church. A difference between the authority of the Apoſtles, and that of the Church. The being of the Church to the worlds end, with power of the Keyes, makes it not infallible. Obedience to Superiors, and the Pillar of truth inferre it not.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The Fathers acknowledge the Sufficience and clearneſs of the Scriptures, as, the Traditions of the Church. They are to be reconciled, by limiting the terms which they uſe. The limitation of thoſe ſayings which make all Chriſtian truth to be contained in the Scriptures. Of thoſe which make the authority of the Church the ground of Faith.

      * CHAP. XXXII. Anſwer to an Objection, that choice of Religion becomes difficult upon theſe terms. This reſolution is for the Intereſt of the Reformation. Thoſe that make the Church Infallible cannot, thoſe that make the Scripture clear and ſufficient may own Tradition for evidence to determine the meaning of the Scriptures, and Controverſies of Faith. The Intereſt of the Church of England. The pretenſe of Ruſhworthes Dialogues, that wee have no unqueſtionable Scripture, and, that the Tradition of the Church never changes.

      * CHAP. XXXI. That the Scriptures which wee have are unqueſtionable. That miſtakes in Copying are not conſiderable to the ſenſe and effect of them. The meaning of the Hebrew and Greek, even of the Prophets, determinable, to the deciding of Controverſies. How Religion delivered by Tradition becomes ſubject to be corrupted.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. The Diſpute concerning the Canon of Scripture, and the tranſlations thereof, in two Queſtions. There can be no Tradition for thoſe books that were written ſince Propheſie ceaſed. Wherein the excellence of them above other books lies. The chief objections againſt them are queſtionable. In thoſe parcels of the New Teſtament that have been queſtioned, the caſe is not the ſame. The ſenſe of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Onely the Original Copy can be Authentick. But, the truth thereof may as well be found in the tranſlations of the Old Teſtament, as in the Jewes Copies. The Jewes have not falſified them of malice. The Points come neither from Moſes, nor Eſdras, but from the Talmud Jewes.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. Of the anci•n eſt Tranſlations of the Bible into Greek firſt; With the Authors and authority of the ſame; Then into the Chaldee, Syriack, and Latine. Exceptions againſt the Greek, and the Samaritane Pentateuch. They are helps nevertheleſs to aſſure the true reading of the Scriptures, though with other Copies; whether Jewiſh or Chriſtian. Though the Vulgar Latine were better than the preſent Greek, yet muſt both depend upon the Original Greek of the New Teſta•ent. No danger to Chriſtianity by the differences remaining in the Bible.

      * CHAP. 1. Two parts of that which remains. How the diſpute concerning the Holy Trinity with Socinus belongs to the firſt. The Queſtion of juſtification by Faith alone. The Opinion of Socinus concerning the whole Covenant of Grace. The opinion of thoſe who make juſtifying Faith the knowledge of a mans Predeſtination, oppoſite to it in the other extream. The difference between it and that of the Antinomians. That there are mean Opinions.

      * CHAP. II. Evidence what is the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. The contract of Baptiſm. The promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt annexed to Chriſts, not to Johns Baptiſm. Thoſe are made Chriſts Diſciples as Chriſtians that take up his Croſſe in Baptiſm. The effects of Baptiſm according to the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. III. The exhortations of the Apoſtles, that are drawn from the patterns of the Old Teſtament, ſuppoſe the ſame. How the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament are the ſame, how not the ſame. How the New Teſtament and the New Covenant are both one. The free-will of man acteth the ſame part in dealing about the New-Covenant, as about the Old. The Gospel a Law.

      * CHAP. IV. The conſent of the whole Church evidenced by the cuſtome of chatechiſing. By the opinion thereof concerning the ſalvation of thoſe that delayed their Baptiſm. By the rites and Ceremonies of Baptiſm. Why no penance for ſins before, but after Baptiſm. The doctrine of the Church of England evident in this caſe.

      * CHAP. V. The Preaching of our Lord and his Apoſtles evidenceth, that ſome act of Mans free choice is the condition which it requireth. The correspondence betwen the Old and New Teſtament inferreth the ſame. So do the errors of Socinians and Antinomians concerning the neceſſity of Baptiſm. Objections deferred.

      * CHAP. VI. Juſtifying Faith ſometimes conſiſts in believing the truth. Sometimes, in truſt in God grounded upon the truth. Somtimes in Chriſtianity, that is in imbracing and profeſſing it. And that in the Fathers as well as in the Scriptures. Of the informed and formed Faith of the Schools.

      * CHAP. VII. The laſt ſignification of Faith is properly justifying Faith. The firſt by a Metonymy of the cauſe: The ſecond of the effect. Thoſe that are not juſtified doe truly believe. The truſt of a Chriſtian preſuppoſeth him to be juſtified. All the promiſes of the Goſpel become due at once by the Covenant of Grace. That, to believe that we are Elect or Juſtified, is not Justifying Faith.

      * CHAP. VIII. The objection from S. Paul; We are not juſtified by the Law nor by Workes, but by Grace and by Faith. Not meant of the Goſpel, and the workes that ſuppoſe it. The queſtion that S. Paul ſpeakes to, is of the Law of Moſes and the Workes of it. He ſets thoſe workes in the ſame rank with the workes of the Gentils by the light of nature. The civil and outward workes of the Law may be done by Gentiles. How the Law is a Pedagogue to Chriſt.

      * CHAP. IX. Of the Faith and Juſtification of Abraham and the Patriarkes, according to the Apoſtles. Of the Prophets and righteous men under the Law. Abraham and Rahab the harlot juſtified by workes, if juſtified by Faith. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend upon works which the Goſpell injoyneth. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. X. What Pelagius queſtioneth concerning the Grace of Chriſt, what Socinus further of the ſtate of Chriſt before his birth. The oppoſition between the firſt and ſecond Adam in S. Paul, evidenceth originall ſinne. Coucupiſcence in the unregenerate, and the inability of the Law to ſubdue it, evict the ſame. The ſecond birth by the holy Ghoſt evidenceth that the first birth propagateth ſinne.

      * CHAP. X. The Old Teſtament chargeth all men as well as the wicked to be ſinfull from the wombe. David complaineth of himſelfe as born in ſinne, no leſſe then the Wiſe man of the children of the Gentiles. How Leviticall Lawes argue the ſame. And temporall death under the Old Teſtament. The book of Wiſdome and the Greek Bible.

It is evident that one God in Trinity was then glorified among the Christians, by the Fullneſſe of the Godhead which they introduced in ſtead of it.

      * CHAP. XIII. The Word was at the beginning of all things. The apparitions of the Old Teſtament Prefaces to the Incarnation of Chriſt. Ambaſſadors are not honoured with the honour due to their Maſters. The Word of God that was afterwards incarnate was in thoſe Angels that ſpoke in Gods Name. No Angel honoured as God under the New Teſtament. The Word was with God at the beginning of all things, as after his return.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Name of God not aſcribed to Chriſt for the like reaſon as to creatures. The reaſons why the Socinians worſhip Chriſt as God do confute their limitations.

Of the forme of God, and of a ſervant in S. Paul.

      * CHAP. XV. Not onely the Church but the World was made by Chriſt. The Word was made fleſh in oppoſition to the Spirit. How the Prophets, how Chriſtians, by receiving the Word of God, are poſſeſſed by his Spirit. How the title of Sonne of God importeth the Godhead. How Chriſt is the brightneſſe and Image of God.

      * CHAP. XVI. The teſtimonies of Chriſts Godhead in the Old Teſtament are firſt underſtood of the figures of Chriſt. Of the Wiſdome of God in Solomon and elſewhere. Of the writings of the Jewes as well before as after Chriſt.

      * CHAP. XVII. Anſwer to thoſe texts of Scripture that ſeem to abate the true Godhead in Chriſt. Of that creature whereof Chriſt is the firſt-borne, and that which the Wiſdome of God made. That this beliefe is the originall Tradition of the Church. What meanes this diſpute furniſheth us with againſt the Arrians. That it is reaſon to ſubmit to revelation concerning the nature of God. The uſe of reaſon is no way renounced by holding this Faith.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The neceſſity of the grace of Chriſt, is the evidence of originall ſinne. How the exaltation of our Lord depends upon his humiliation, and the grace of Christ upon that▪ All the work of Chriſtianity is aſcribed to the grace of Chriſt. Gods predeſtination manifeſteth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XIX. Evidences of the ſame in the Old Teſtament; Of Gods help in getting the Land of Promiſe, and renewing the Covenant: And that for Chriſts ſake.

Whether man were at the firſt created to a ſupernaturall end, or not. An eſtate of meer nature, but innocent, poſſible. Originall ſinne is Concupiſcence. How Baptiſme voids it.

      * CHAP. XXI. The opinion that mak•s the Predetermination of mans will by God the ſourſe of his freedom; And wherein Janſenius differs from it. Of neceſsity upon ſuppoſition & abſolute. The neceſsity of the Will following the last dictate of the underſtanding is onely upon ſuppoſition, As alſo that which Gods foreſight creates. The difference between indifferent and undetermined.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Goſpel findeth man free from neceſſity, though not from bondage. Of the Antecedent and Conſequent Will of God. Praedetermination not the root, but the rooting up of Freedome and of Chriſtianity. Againſt the opinion of Janſenius.

      * CHAP. XXIII. A man is able to doe things truely honeſt under Originall ſin. But not to make God the end of all his doings. How all the actions of the Gentiles are ſins. They are accountable onely for the Law of nature. How all men have or have not Grace ſufficient to ſave.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Though God determineth not the will immediately, yet he determineth the effect thereof by the meanes of his providence, preſenting the object ſo as he foreſees it will chuſe, The caſes of Pharoah, of Solomon, of Ahab, and of the Jewes that crucified Chriſt. Of Gods foreknowledg of future conditionalls that come not to paſſe. The ground of foreknowledg of future contingencies. Difficult objections anſwered.

      * CHAP. XXV. The grounds of the difference between ſufficient and effectuall. How naturall occaſions, conduce to ſupernaturall actions, The inſufficience of Janſenius his doctrine. Of ſufficient grace under the Law of Moſes and Nature.

      * CHAP. XXVI. Predeſtination to grace abſolute, to glory reſpective: Purpoſe of denying effectuall Grace abſolute, of puniſhing reſpective. The end, to which God predeſtinates, is not the end for which he predeſtinates. Grace the reward of the right uſe of Grace. How much of the queſtion the Goſpell determines not. That our indeavours are ingaged no leſſe, then if predeſtination were not, it determineth. Of the Tradition of the Church; and of Semipelagians, Predeſtinatians and Arminians.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The queſtion concerning the ſatisfaction of Chriſt with Socinus. The reaſon why Sacrifices are figures of Chriſt, common to all ſacrifices. Why, and what Sacrifices the Fathers had, what the Law added. Of our ranſom by the price of Chriſts propitiatory Sacrifice.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Chriſt took away our ſinne by bearing the puniſhment of it. The Propheſie of Eſay LIII. We are reconciled to God by the Goſpel, in conſideration of Chriſts obedience. The reconcilement of Jews and Gentiles, Men and Angels, conſequent to the ſame. Of purging and expiating ſinne by Chriſt, and making propitiation for it. Of Chriſts dying for us.

      * CHAP. XXIX. The grant of Grace, in conſideration of Chriſt, ſuppoſes ſatisfaction made by him for ſinne. Neither our ſinnes imputable to Chriſt, nor his ſufferings to us, formally and perſonally, but, as the meritorious cauſes which ſatisfaction anſwereth. The effect of it, the Covenant of Grace, as well as help to performe it. The Fathers ſaved by the Faith of Chriſt to come. The Goſpel a new Law. The property of Satisfaction and Puniſhment in Chriſts ſufferings. Of the ſenſe of the Catholike Church.

      * CHAP. XXX. God might have reconciled man to himſelf without the coming of Chriſt. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend as well upon his active as paſſive obedience. Chriſt need not ſuffer •ell pa•nes that we might not. The opinion that maketh juſtifying Faith to be truſt in God not true; Yet not prejudiciall to the Faith. The decree of the Council of Trent, and the doctrine of the Schoole; how it is not prejudiciall to the Faith. As alſo that of Socinus.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ſtate of the queſtion concerning the perſeverance of thoſe that are once juſtified.

The recovery of Gods grace for a Chriſtian fallen from it, a work of labour and time. The neceſſity and efficacy of Penance to that purpoſe, according to the Scriptures, and the practiſe of the Church. Merit by virtue of Gods promiſe, neceſſary. The Catholicke Church agrees in it, the preſent Church of Rome allowes merit of juſtice▪

      * CHAP. I. The Society of the Church founded upon the duty of communicating in the Offices of Gods Service. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt, among thoſe Offices, proper to Chriſtianity. What opinions, concerning the preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood in the Euchariſt, are on foot.

      * CHAP. II. That the natural ſubſtance of the Elements remains in the Sacrament. That the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is nevertheleſſe preſent in the ſame, when it is received, not by the receiving of it. The eating of the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe neceſſarily requireth the ſame. This cauſes no contradiction nor improperty in the words of our Lord.

      * CHAP. III. That the preſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt depends not upon the living Faith of him that receives, but upon the true profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the Church that celebrates. The Scriptures that are alleged for the dependence of it upon the communication of the properties. They conclude not the ſenſe of them by whom they are alleged. How the Scripture confineth the fleſh of Chriſt to the Heavens.

      * CHAP. IV. The opinion which maketh the Conſecration to be done by rehearſing the operative words. That our Lord conſecrated by Thanksgiving. The Form of it in all Liturgies, together with the conſent of the Fathers. Evidence, that there is no Tradition of the Church for the aboliſhing of the Elements.

      * CHAP. V. It cannot be proved by the Old Teſtament that the Euchariſt is a Sacrifice. How, by the New Teſtament it may be ſo accounted. Four reaſons thereof, depending upon the nature of Juſtifying Faith premiſed. The conſent of the Catholick Church. The concurrence of the Church of England to the premiſes.

      * CHAP. VI. The reaſon of the Order by which I proceed, brings me to the Baptiſm of Infants in the next place. The power of the Keyes ſeen in granting Baptiſm, as well as in communicating the Euchariſt. Why Socinians make Baptiſm indifferent: Why Antinomians make it a miſtake to Baptize. The grounds upon which I ſhake off both: With anſwer to ſome objections.

      * CHAP. VII. The ground of baptizing Infants Originall ſinne, though not inſtituted till Chriſt roſe again. No other cure for it. Infants of Chriſtians may be Diſciples, are holy. The effect of Circumciſion under the Law, inferreth the effect of Baptiſm under the Goſpel.

      * CHAP. VIII. What is alleadged to impeach Tradition for baptizing Infants; Proves not, that any could be ſaved regularly, who dyed unbaptized; but, that, baptizing at yeares was a ſtrong means to make good Chriſtians. Why the Church now Baptize, Infants. What becomes of Infants dying unbaptized, unanſwerable. What thoſe Infants g•t who dye baptized.

      * CHAP. IX. What controverſie the Reformation hath with the Church of Rome about Penance. Inward repentance that is ſincere, obtaineth pardon alone. Remiſſion of ſinnes by the Goſpel onely: The condition of it by the Miniſtrey of the Church. What the power of binding and looſing contains more then Preaching, or taking away offenſes. Sinne may be pardoned without the uſe of it. Wherein the neceſſity of uſing it lyeth.

      * CHAP. X. The Sects of the Montaniſts, Novations, Donatiſts, and Meletians, evidence the cure of ſinne by Penance, to be a Tradition of the Apoſtles. So doth the agreement of primitive practice with their writings. Indulgence of regular Penance from the Apoſtles. Confeſſion of ſecret ſinnes in the Primitive Church. That no ſinne can be cured without the Keyes of the Church, there is no Tradition from the Apoſtles. The neceſſity of confeſſing ſecret ſinnes, whereupon it ſtands.

      * CHAP. IX. Penance is not required to redeem tho debt of temporall puniſhment when the ſinne is pardoned. What aſſurance of forgiveneſſe, the law of auricular Confeſſion, as it is uſed in the Church of Rome, procureth Of injoyning Penance, after abſolution performed. Setting aſide abuſes, the Law is agreeable to Gods. Of the order taken by the Church of England.

      * CHAP. XI. The Unction of the ſick pretendeth onely bodily health, upon ſuppoſition of the cure of ſinne by the Keyes of the Church. Objections anſwered. The Tradition of the Church evidenceth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XII. The ground of the Right of the Church in Matrimonial cauſes. Mariage of one with one inſolubly is a Law of Chriſtianity; The Law of Moſes not injoyning it. The Law of the Empire not aiming at the ground of it. Evidence from the primitive practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XIV. Scripture alleged to prove the bond of Mariage inſoluble in caſe of adultery, uneffectuall. S. Paul and our Lord ſpeak both to one purpoſe, according to S. Jerome, and S. Auſtine. The contrary opinion more reaſonable, and more general in the Church. Why the Church may reſtrain the innocent party from marying again. The Imperial Lawes could never be of force to void the Power of the Church. Evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIV. Another opinion, admitting the ground of lawfull Impediments. What Impediments ariſe upon the Conſtitution of the Church, generally as a Society, or particularly, as of Chriſtians.

Of Alexandria, Antiochia, Jeruſalem and Rome. Ground for the pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, before all Churches. The conſequence of that Ground. A ſummary of the evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIX. Of the proceedings about Marcion and Montanus at Rome. The buſineſse of Pope Victor about keeping Eaſter; a peremptory inſtance. The buſineſſe of the Novatians evidenceth the ſame. Of the buſineſſes concerning the rebaptizing of Hereticks, Dionyſius of Alexandria, Paulus Samoſatenus, S. Cypriane, and, of the Donatiſts under Conſtantine.

      * CHAP. XX. Of the conſtitution and authority of Councils. The ground of the pre-eminences of Churches in the Romane Empire. The VI. Canon of the Council of Nicaea.

      * CHAP. XXII. The people of God •ied to build Synagogues, though not by the leter of the Law. The Church to provide Churches, though the Scripture command it not. Preſcribing the form of Gods publick ſervice, is not quenching the Spirit. The Pſalter is preſcribed the Church for Gods Praiſes.

      * CHAP. XXIII. The conſideration of the Euchariſt preſcribed by Tradition, for the mater of it. Lords Prayer preſcribed in all ſervices. The mater of Prayers for all eſtates preſcribed. The form of Baptiſm neceſſary to be preſcribed. The ſame reaſon holdeth in the forms of other Offices.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Prayer the more principall Office of Gods ſervice then Preaching. Preachings, neither Gods word, nor the meanes of ſalvation, unleſſe limited to the Faith of Gods Church.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The Soules of the Fathers were not in the Devils Power till Chriſt; Though the Old Teſtament declare not their eſtate. Of Samuels ſoul. The ſoul of our Lord Chriſt, parting from his body, went with the Thiefe to Paradiſe. Of his triumph over the powers of darkneſſe. Prayer for the dead ſignifieth no delivering of ſoules out of Purgatory. The Covenant of Grace requires imperfect happineſſe before the generall judgement. Of forgiveneſſe in the world to come, and, paying the utmoſt farthing.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Ancient opinions in the Church, of the place of ſoules before the day of judgement. No Tradition that the Fathers were in the Ʋerge of Hell, under the Earth.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ground for a Monaſticall life in the Scriptures; And in the practice of the primitive Church. The Church getteth no peculiar intereſt in them who profeſſe it, by their profeſſing of it. The nature and intent of it renders it ſubordinate to the Clergy. How farre the ſingle life of the Clergy hath been a Law to the Church. Inexecution of the Canons for it. Nullity of the proceeddings of the Church of Rome in it. The intereſt of the People in the acts of the Church; And in the uſe of the Scriptures.

    _ The Third BOOK.

      * CHAP. I. All agree, that Reaſon is to decide controverſies of Faith. The objection, that Faith is taught by Gods Spirit, anſwered. What Reaſon decideth queſtions of Faith. The reſolution of Faith ends not in the light of Reaſon, but in that which Reaſon evidenceth to come from Gods meſſengers.

      * CHAP. II. The queſtion between the Scripture and the Church, which of them is Judge in matters of Faith. Whether opinion, the Tradition of the Church ſtands better with. Thoſe that hold the Scripture to be clear in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, have no reaſon to exclude the Tradition of the Church. What opinions they are, that deny the Church to be a Society or Corporation by Gods Law.

      * CHAP. III. That neither the ſentence of the Church, nor the dictate of Gods Spirit, can be the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be received. No man can know that hee hath Gods Spirit, without knowing that hee is a true Chriſtian; Which ſuppoſeth the truth of the Scripture. The motives of Faith are the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be believed: And the conſent of Gods people the reaſon that evidences thoſe motives to be infallibly true. How the Scriptures are believed for themſelves. How a Circle is made in rendering a reaſon of the Faith. The Scriptures are Gods Law to all, to whom they are publiſhed, by Gods act of publiſhing them; But Civil Law, by the act of Soveraign Powers, in acting Chriſtianity upon their Subjects.

      * CHAP. IV. Neither the Dictate of Gods Spirit nor the authority of the Church is the reaſon of believing any thing in Chriſtianity. Whether the Church be before the Scripture, or the Scripture before the Church. The Scriptures contain not the Infallibility of the Church. Nor the conſent of all Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. V. All things neceſſary to ſalvation are not clear in the Scriptures to all underſtandings. Not in the Old Teſtament. Not in the Goſpel. Not in the Writings of the Apoſtles. It is neceſſary to ſalvation to believe more than this, that our Lord is the Chriſt. Time cauſeth obſcurity in the Scriptures, aſwell as in other Records. That it is no where ſaid in the Scriptures, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are clear in the Scriptures. Neither is there any conſent of all Chriſtians to evidence the ſame.

      * CHAP. VI. All interpretation of Scripture is to be confined within the Tradition of the Church. This ſuppoſeth that the Church is a Communion inſtituted by God. What means there is to make evidence of Gods Charter, upon which the Corporation of the Church ſubſiſteth. The name of the Church, in the Scriptures, often ſignifieth the Whole or Cathelick Church.

      * CHAP. VII. That the Apoſtles delivered to the Church a Summary of Chriſtianity, which, all ſhould be baptized were to profeſs. Evidence out of the Scriptures. Evidence out of the Scriptures for Tradition regulating the Communion of the Church, and the Order of it. Evidence for the Rule of Faith, out of the records of the Church. For the Canons of the Church, and the pedegree of them from the Order eſtabliſhed in the Church by the Apoſtles. That the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and that by being baptized, is neceſſary to the ſalvation of a Chriſtian.

      * CHAP. VIII. That the Power of Governing the whole Church was in the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, and thoſe whom they took to aſſiſt them in the parts of it. The Power of their Succeſſors muſt needs be derived from thoſe. Why that Succeſſion which appeares in one Church, neceſſarily holdeth all Churches. The holding of Councils evidenceth the Ʋnity of the Church.

      * CHAP. IX. The Keyes of the Church given the Apoſtles, and exerciſed by Excommunication under the Apoſtles. The ground thereof is that profeſſion, which, all that are baptized are to make. That Penance and abatemeut of Penance hath been in force ever ſince and under the Apoſtles. In particular, of excluding Hereticks.

      * CHAP. X. Evidence of the Apoſtles act from the effect of it, in preſerving the Ʋnity of the Church. Of the buſineſſe of Marcion and Montanus. That about keeping Eaſter. That of the Novations, of rebaptizing Hereticks, of Paulus Samoſatenus, of Dionyſius Alexandrinus, and Arius. Of communicatory leters, and the intercourſe of the Church under and after the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. XI.Ʋpon what grounds the firſt book de Synedriis holds that the Church cannot excommunicate. Before the Law there was no ſuch Power, nor by it. Chriſtians went for Jewes under the Apoſtles. His ſenſe of ſome Scriptures. What the Leviatha• ſaith in general concerning the Power of the Church. Both ſuppoſe that Eccleſiaſtical Power includeth Temporal, which is not true. Of the Oxford Doctors Paraeneſis.

      * CHAP. XII. That the Law experſly covenanted for the Land of Promiſe. A great Objection againſt this, from the Great precept of the Law. The hope of the world to come under the Law, and the obedience which it requireth, was grounded upon reaſon from the true God, the Tradition of the Fathers, and the Doctrine of the Prophets. The Love of God above all by the Law extendeth no further than the precepts of the Law, the love of our Neighbor onely to Jewes. Of the Ceremonial, Judicial and Moral Law.

      * CHAP. XIII. That the Law tendreth no other promiſe but that of the Land of Canaan. How the Reſurrection is ſignified by the Prophets. Expreſſe texts of the Apoſtles. Their arguments, and the arguments of our Lord do ſuppoſe the myſtical ſenſe of the Scriptures. That this ſenſe is to be made good throughout the Scripture, whereſoever the ground of it takes place; Chriſtianity well grounded ſuppoſing this. What parts of Scripture may be queſtionable, whether they have a myſtical ſenſe or not. The ſayings and doings of our Lord have it; As alſo thoſe paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which are fulfilled by the ſame. The ſenſe of the Fathers.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Leviathans opin•on, that Chriſt came to reſtore that kingdome of God which the Jewes caſt off when they rejected Samuel. It overthroweth the foundation of Chriſtianity. The true Government of Gods ancient people. The name of the Church in the New Teſtament cannot ſignifie the Synagogue. Nor any Chriſtian State.

      * CHAP. XV. How the Power of the Church is founded upon the Law. The Power of the Kingdome, Prieſthood, Prophets, and Rulers of that people all of divine right. How farre theſe qualities and the powers of them are to continue in the Church. The ſenſe of the Fathers in this point. That the acts of S. Paul and the reſt of the Apoſtles were not of force by virtue of the Law. What Eccleſiaſtical Power ſhould have been among the Jewes, in caſe they had received the Goſpel, and ſo the State had ſtood.

      * CHAP. XVI. The Church founded upon the Power given the Apoſtles. What is the ſubject mater of Church Lawes. The right of the Church to Tithes and Oblations is not grounded upon the Law, though evidenced by it, and by practice of the Patriarchs. Evidence of the Apoſtles Order in the Scriptures. The Church of Jeruſalem held not community of Goods. The original practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power of Excommunication in the Church is not founded in the Law. What argument there is of it in the Old Teſtament. The allegorical ſenſe thereof is argumentative. It was not neceſſary that the Chriſtians ſhould incurre perſecution for uſing the Power of the Keyes, and not by virtue of the Law.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The difference between S. Pauls anathema and that of the Jewes. It is not neceſſary that the Chriſtians anathema ſhould ſignifie curſing. That the inceſtuous perſon at Corinth was Excommunicated by S. Paul. Juriſdiction of the Church. Telling the Church, binding and looſing, holding him that is bound for a Heathen or a Publicane, ſigniſie the ſame. The coherence of our Lords diſcourſe. Of Excommunication and Indulgence by private perſons in the Ancient Church. That Excommunication and the Power of the Church could not come in force by the voluntary conſent of the firſt Chriſtians. How it may be ſaid to be voluntary. Of the confederacy of the primitive Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XIX. That Power which was in Churches under the Apoſtles, can never be in any Chriſtian Soveraign. The difference between the Church and the Synagogue in that regard. The intereſt of Secular Power in determining maters of Faith preſuppoſeth the Society of the Church, and the act of it. No man can be bound to profeſſe the contrary of that which hee believeth. Every man is bound to profeſſe that Chriſtianity which hee believeth. The Church is the chief Teacher of Chriſtianity through Chriſtendom, as the Soveraign of Civil Peace, thorough his Dominions. Why the Church is to decide maters of Faith rather than the State, neither being infallible.

      * CHAP. XX. The reſt of the Oxford Doctors pretenſe. The Power of binding and looſing ſuppoſeth not onely the Preaching of the Goſpel, but the outward act of Faith. Chriſtians are not at liberty to caſt themſelves into what formes of Churches the Law of Nature alloweth. They are Judges in chief for themſelves in mater of Religion, ſuppoſing the Catholick Church; not otherwiſe. Secular Power cannot puniſh for Religion, but ſuppoſing the act of the Church, nor do any act to inforce Religion, unleſſe the Church determine the mater of it.

      * CHAP. XXI. How the Tradition of the Church limits the interpretation of Scriptures. How the declaration of the Church becomes a reaſonable mark of Hereſie. That which is not found in the Scriptures may have been delivered by the Apoſtles. Some things delivered by the Apoſtles, and recorded in the Scriptures; may not oblige. S. Auſtines Rule of Apoſtolical Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Authority of the Fathers is not grounded upon any preſumption of their Learning or Holineſſe. How farr they challenge the credit of Hiſtorical truth. The pre-eminenee of the Primitive. The preſumption that is grounded upon their ranks and qualities in the Church. Of Arnobius, Lactantius, Tertullian, Origen, Clemens, and the approbation of poſterity.

      * CHAP. XXIII. Two inſtances againſt the premiſes, beſides the objection concerning the beginning of Antichriſt under the Apoſtles. The general anſwer to it. The ſeven Trumpets in the Apocalypſe fore-tell the deſtruction of the Jewes. The ſeven Vials, the plagues inflicted upon the Empire for the ten perſecutions. The correſpondence of Deniels Propheſie inferreth the ſame. Neither S. Pauls Prophe••e nor S. Johns concerneth any Chriſtian. Neither the opinion of the Chiliaſts, nor the giving of the Euchariſt to Infants new Baptized, Catholick.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Two ſorts of means to reſolve whatſoever is reſolvable concerning the Scripture. Upon what terms the Church may, or is to determine controverſies of Faith. And what obligation that determination produceth. Traditions of the Apoſtles oblige the preſent Church, as the reaſons of them continue or not. Inſtances in our Lords Paſſeover and Euchariſt. Penance under the Apoſtles, and afterwards. S. Pauls vail, eating blood, and things offered to Idols. The power of the Church in limiting theſe Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXV. The power of the Church in limiting even the Traditions of the Apoſtles. Not every abuſe of this power, a ſufficient warrant for particular Churches to reforme themſelves. Hereſie conſiſts in denying ſomething, neceſſary to ſalvation to be believed. Schiſm, in departing from the unity of the Church, whether upon that, or any other cauſe. Implicite Faith no virtue; but the effect of it may be the work of Chriſtian charity.

      * CHAP. XXVI. What it is to adde to Gods Law; What to adde the Apocalypſe. S. Pauls Anathema. The Beraeans. S. Johns Goſpel ſufficient to make one believe; and the Scriptures, The man of God perfit. How the Law giveth light, and Chriſtians are taught by God. How Idolatry is ſaid, not to be commanded by God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. Why it was death to tranſgreſs the determinations of the Jews Conſiſtory, and what power this argueth in the Church. A difference between the authority of the Apoſtles, and that of the Church. The being of the Church to the worlds end, with power of the Keyes, makes it not infallible. Obedience to Superiors, and the Pillar of truth inferre it not.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The Fathers acknowledge the Sufficience and clearneſs of the Scriptures, as, the Traditions of the Church. They are to be reconciled, by limiting the terms which they uſe. The limitation of thoſe ſayings which make all Chriſtian truth to be contained in the Scriptures. Of thoſe which make the authority of the Church the ground of Faith.

      * CHAP. XXXII. Anſwer to an Objection, that choice of Religion becomes difficult upon theſe terms. This reſolution is for the Intereſt of the Reformation. Thoſe that make the Church Infallible cannot, thoſe that make the Scripture clear and ſufficient may own Tradition for evidence to determine the meaning of the Scriptures, and Controverſies of Faith. The Intereſt of the Church of England. The pretenſe of Ruſhworthes Dialogues, that wee have no unqueſtionable Scripture, and, that the Tradition of the Church never changes.

      * CHAP. XXXI. That the Scriptures which wee have are unqueſtionable. That miſtakes in Copying are not conſiderable to the ſenſe and effect of them. The meaning of the Hebrew and Greek, even of the Prophets, determinable, to the deciding of Controverſies. How Religion delivered by Tradition becomes ſubject to be corrupted.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. The Diſpute concerning the Canon of Scripture, and the tranſlations thereof, in two Queſtions. There can be no Tradition for thoſe books that were written ſince Propheſie ceaſed. Wherein the excellence of them above other books lies. The chief objections againſt them are queſtionable. In thoſe parcels of the New Teſtament that have been queſtioned, the caſe is not the ſame. The ſenſe of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Onely the Original Copy can be Authentick. But, the truth thereof may as well be found in the tranſlations of the Old Teſtament, as in the Jewes Copies. The Jewes have not falſified them of malice. The Points come neither from Moſes, nor Eſdras, but from the Talmud Jewes.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. Of the anci•n eſt Tranſlations of the Bible into Greek firſt; With the Authors and authority of the ſame; Then into the Chaldee, Syriack, and Latine. Exceptions againſt the Greek, and the Samaritane Pentateuch. They are helps nevertheleſs to aſſure the true reading of the Scriptures, though with other Copies; whether Jewiſh or Chriſtian. Though the Vulgar Latine were better than the preſent Greek, yet muſt both depend upon the Original Greek of the New Teſta•ent. No danger to Chriſtianity by the differences remaining in the Bible.

      * CHAP. 1. Two parts of that which remains. How the diſpute concerning the Holy Trinity with Socinus belongs to the firſt. The Queſtion of juſtification by Faith alone. The Opinion of Socinus concerning the whole Covenant of Grace. The opinion of thoſe who make juſtifying Faith the knowledge of a mans Predeſtination, oppoſite to it in the other extream. The difference between it and that of the Antinomians. That there are mean Opinions.

      * CHAP. II. Evidence what is the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. The contract of Baptiſm. The promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt annexed to Chriſts, not to Johns Baptiſm. Thoſe are made Chriſts Diſciples as Chriſtians that take up his Croſſe in Baptiſm. The effects of Baptiſm according to the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. III. The exhortations of the Apoſtles, that are drawn from the patterns of the Old Teſtament, ſuppoſe the ſame. How the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament are the ſame, how not the ſame. How the New Teſtament and the New Covenant are both one. The free-will of man acteth the ſame part in dealing about the New-Covenant, as about the Old. The Gospel a Law.

      * CHAP. IV. The conſent of the whole Church evidenced by the cuſtome of chatechiſing. By the opinion thereof concerning the ſalvation of thoſe that delayed their Baptiſm. By the rites and Ceremonies of Baptiſm. Why no penance for ſins before, but after Baptiſm. The doctrine of the Church of England evident in this caſe.

      * CHAP. V. The Preaching of our Lord and his Apoſtles evidenceth, that ſome act of Mans free choice is the condition which it requireth. The correspondence betwen the Old and New Teſtament inferreth the ſame. So do the errors of Socinians and Antinomians concerning the neceſſity of Baptiſm. Objections deferred.

      * CHAP. VI. Juſtifying Faith ſometimes conſiſts in believing the truth. Sometimes, in truſt in God grounded upon the truth. Somtimes in Chriſtianity, that is in imbracing and profeſſing it. And that in the Fathers as well as in the Scriptures. Of the informed and formed Faith of the Schools.

      * CHAP. VII. The laſt ſignification of Faith is properly justifying Faith. The firſt by a Metonymy of the cauſe: The ſecond of the effect. Thoſe that are not juſtified doe truly believe. The truſt of a Chriſtian preſuppoſeth him to be juſtified. All the promiſes of the Goſpel become due at once by the Covenant of Grace. That, to believe that we are Elect or Juſtified, is not Justifying Faith.

      * CHAP. VIII. The objection from S. Paul; We are not juſtified by the Law nor by Workes, but by Grace and by Faith. Not meant of the Goſpel, and the workes that ſuppoſe it. The queſtion that S. Paul ſpeakes to, is of the Law of Moſes and the Workes of it. He ſets thoſe workes in the ſame rank with the workes of the Gentils by the light of nature. The civil and outward workes of the Law may be done by Gentiles. How the Law is a Pedagogue to Chriſt.

      * CHAP. IX. Of the Faith and Juſtification of Abraham and the Patriarkes, according to the Apoſtles. Of the Prophets and righteous men under the Law. Abraham and Rahab the harlot juſtified by workes, if juſtified by Faith. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend upon works which the Goſpell injoyneth. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. X. What Pelagius queſtioneth concerning the Grace of Chriſt, what Socinus further of the ſtate of Chriſt before his birth. The oppoſition between the firſt and ſecond Adam in S. Paul, evidenceth originall ſinne. Coucupiſcence in the unregenerate, and the inability of the Law to ſubdue it, evict the ſame. The ſecond birth by the holy Ghoſt evidenceth that the first birth propagateth ſinne.

      * CHAP. X. The Old Teſtament chargeth all men as well as the wicked to be ſinfull from the wombe. David complaineth of himſelfe as born in ſinne, no leſſe then the Wiſe man of the children of the Gentiles. How Leviticall Lawes argue the ſame. And temporall death under the Old Teſtament. The book of Wiſdome and the Greek Bible.

      * CHAP. XII. The Haereſie of Simon Magus the beginning of the Gnoſticks. That they were in being during the Apoſtles time. Where and when the Haereſie of Cerinthus prevailed, and, that they were Gnoſticks. The beginning of the Encratites under the Apostles. It is evident that one God in Trinity was then glorified among the Christians, by the Fullneſſe of the Godhead which they introduced in ſtead of it.

      * CHAP. XIII. The Word was at the beginning of all things. The apparitions of the Old Teſtament Prefaces to the Incarnation of Chriſt. Ambaſſadors are not honoured with the honour due to their Maſters. The Word of God that was afterwards incarnate was in thoſe Angels that ſpoke in Gods Name. No Angel honoured as God under the New Teſtament. The Word was with God at the beginning of all things, as after his return.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Name of God not aſcribed to Chriſt for the like reaſon as to creatures. The reaſons why the Socinians worſhip Chriſt as God do confute their limitations. Chriſt not God by virtue of his riſing againe. He is the Great God with S. Paul, the true God, with S. John, the onely Lord, with S. Jude. Other Scriptures. Of the forme of God, and of a ſervant in S. Paul.

      * CHAP. XV. Not onely the Church but the World was made by Chriſt. The Word was made fleſh in oppoſition to the Spirit. How the Prophets, how Chriſtians, by receiving the Word of God, are poſſeſſed by his Spirit. How the title of Sonne of God importeth the Godhead. How Chriſt is the brightneſſe and Image of God.

      * CHAP. XVI. The teſtimonies of Chriſts Godhead in the Old Teſtament are firſt underſtood of the figures of Chriſt. Of the Wiſdome of God in Solomon and elſewhere. Of the writings of the Jewes as well before as after Chriſt.

      * CHAP. XVII. Anſwer to thoſe texts of Scripture that ſeem to abate the true Godhead in Chriſt. Of that creature whereof Chriſt is the firſt-borne, and that which the Wiſdome of God made. That this beliefe is the originall Tradition of the Church. What meanes this diſpute furniſheth us with againſt the Arrians. That it is reaſon to ſubmit to revelation concerning the nature of God. The uſe of reaſon is no way renounced by holding this Faith.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The neceſſity of the grace of Chriſt, is the evidence of originall ſinne. How the exaltation of our Lord depends upon his humiliation, and the grace of Christ upon that▪ All the work of Chriſtianity is aſcribed to the grace of Chriſt. Gods predeſtination manifeſteth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XIX. Evidences of the ſame in the Old Teſtament; Of Gods help in getting the Land of Promiſe, and renewing the Covenant: And that for Chriſts ſake. That Chriſtianity cannot ſtand without acknowledging the grace of Chriſt. The Tradition of the Church; In the Baptiſme of Infants: In the Prayers of the Church; In the decrees against Pelagius and other records of the Church.

      * CHAP. XX. Wherein Originall ſinne conſiſteth; What opinions are on foot. That it is not Adams ſinne imputed to his poſterity. Whether man were at the firſt created to a ſupernaturall end, or not. An eſtate of meer nature, but innocent, poſſible. Originall ſinne is Concupiſcence. How Baptiſme voids it. Concerning the late novelty in the Church of England about Originall ſinne.

      * CHAP. XXI. The opinion that mak•s the Predetermination of mans will by God the ſourſe of his freedom; And wherein Janſenius differs from it. Of neceſsity upon ſuppoſition & abſolute. The neceſsity of the Will following the last dictate of the underſtanding is onely upon ſuppoſition, As alſo that which Gods foreſight creates. The difference between indifferent and undetermined.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Goſpel findeth man free from neceſſity, though not from bondage. Of the Antecedent and Conſequent Will of God. Praedetermination not the root, but the rooting up of Freedome and of Chriſtianity. Againſt the opinion of Janſenius.

      * CHAP. XXIII. A man is able to doe things truely honeſt under Originall ſin. But not to make God the end of all his doings. How all the actions of the Gentiles are ſins. They are accountable onely for the Law of nature. How all men have or have not Grace ſufficient to ſave.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Though God determineth not the will immediately, yet he determineth the effect thereof by the meanes of his providence, preſenting the object ſo as he foreſees it will chuſe, The caſes of Pharoah, of Solomon, of Ahab, and of the Jewes that crucified Chriſt. Of Gods foreknowledg of future conditionalls that come not to paſſe. The ground of foreknowledg of future contingencies. Difficult objections anſwered.

      * CHAP. XXV. The grounds of the difference between ſufficient and effectuall. How naturall occaſions, conduce to ſupernaturall actions, The inſufficience of Janſenius his doctrine. Of ſufficient grace under the Law of Moſes and Nature.

      * CHAP. XXVI. Predeſtination to grace abſolute, to glory reſpective: Purpoſe of denying effectuall Grace abſolute, of puniſhing reſpective. The end, to which God predeſtinates, is not the end for which he predeſtinates. Grace the reward of the right uſe of Grace. How much of the queſtion the Goſpell determines not. That our indeavours are ingaged no leſſe, then if predeſtination were not, it determineth. Of the Tradition of the Church; and of Semipelagians, Predeſtinatians and Arminians.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The queſtion concerning the ſatisfaction of Chriſt with Socinus. The reaſon why Sacrifices are figures of Chriſt, common to all ſacrifices. Why, and what Sacrifices the Fathers had, what the Law added. Of our ranſom by the price of Chriſts propitiatory Sacrifice.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Chriſt took away our ſinne by bearing the puniſhment of it. The Propheſie of Eſay LIII. We are reconciled to God by the Goſpel, in conſideration of Chriſts obedience. The reconcilement of Jews and Gentiles, Men and Angels, conſequent to the ſame. Of purging and expiating ſinne by Chriſt, and making propitiation for it. Of Chriſts dying for us.

      * CHAP. XXIX. The grant of Grace, in conſideration of Chriſt, ſuppoſes ſatisfaction made by him for ſinne. Neither our ſinnes imputable to Chriſt, nor his ſufferings to us, formally and perſonally, but, as the meritorious cauſes which ſatisfaction anſwereth. The effect of it, the Covenant of Grace, as well as help to performe it. The Fathers ſaved by the Faith of Chriſt to come. The Goſpel a new Law. The property of Satisfaction and Puniſhment in Chriſts ſufferings. Of the ſenſe of the Catholike Church.

      * CHAP. XXX. God might have reconciled man to himſelf without the coming of Chriſt. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend as well upon his active as paſſive obedience. Chriſt need not ſuffer •ell pa•nes that we might not. The opinion that maketh juſtifying Faith to be truſt in God not true; Yet not prejudiciall to the Faith. The decree of the Council of Trent, and the doctrine of the Schoole; how it is not prejudiciall to the Faith. As alſo that of Socinus.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ſtate of the queſtion concerning the perſeverance of thoſe that are once juſtified. Of three ſenſes, one true, one inconſiſtent with the Faith, the third neither true nor yet deſtructive to the Faith. Evidence from the writings of the Apoſtles. From the Old Teſtament. The grace of Propheſie when it preſuppoſeth ſanctifying grace. Anſwer to ſome Texts, and of S. Pauls meaning in the VII. of the Romans. Of the Polygamy of the Fathers. What aſſurance of Grace Chriſtians may have. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How the fullfilling of Gods Law is poſſible, how impoſſible▪ for a Chriſtian. Of the difference between mortall and v•niall ſinne. What love of God and of our neighbour was neceſſary under the Old Teſtament. Whether the S•rmon in the Mount correct the falſe interpretation of the Jewes, or inhanſe the obligation of the Law. Of the difference between matter of Precept and matter of Counſail; and the Perfection of Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Whether any workes of Chriſtians be ſatisfactory for ſinne, and meritorious of heaven, or not. The recovery of Gods grace for a Chriſtian fallen from it, a work of labour and time. The neceſſity and efficacy of Penance to that purpoſe, according to the Scriptures, and the practiſe of the Church. Merit by virtue of Gods promiſe, neceſſary. The Catholicke Church agrees in it, the preſent Church of Rome allowes merit of juſtice▪

      * CHAP. I. The Society of the Church founded upon the duty of communicating in the Offices of Gods Service. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt, among thoſe Offices, proper to Chriſtianity. What opinions, concerning the preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood in the Euchariſt, are on foot.

      * CHAP. II. That the natural ſubſtance of the Elements remains in the Sacrament. That the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is nevertheleſſe preſent in the ſame, when it is received, not by the receiving of it. The eating of the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe neceſſarily requireth the ſame. This cauſes no contradiction nor improperty in the words of our Lord.

      * CHAP. III. That the preſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt depends not upon the living Faith of him that receives, but upon the true profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the Church that celebrates. The Scriptures that are alleged for the dependence of it upon the communication of the properties. They conclude not the ſenſe of them by whom they are alleged. How the Scripture confineth the fleſh of Chriſt to the Heavens.

      * CHAP. IV. The opinion which maketh the Conſecration to be done by rehearſing the operative words. That our Lord conſecrated by Thanksgiving. The Form of it in all Liturgies, together with the conſent of the Fathers. Evidence, that there is no Tradition of the Church for the aboliſhing of the Elements.

      * CHAP. V. It cannot be proved by the Old Teſtament that the Euchariſt is a Sacrifice. How, by the New Teſtament it may be ſo accounted. Four reaſons thereof, depending upon the nature of Juſtifying Faith premiſed. The conſent of the Catholick Church. The concurrence of the Church of England to the premiſes.

      * CHAP. VI. The reaſon of the Order by which I proceed, brings me to the Baptiſm of Infants in the next place. The power of the Keyes ſeen in granting Baptiſm, as well as in communicating the Euchariſt. Why Socinians make Baptiſm indifferent: Why Antinomians make it a miſtake to Baptize. The grounds upon which I ſhake off both: With anſwer to ſome objections.

      * CHAP. VII. The ground of baptizing Infants Originall ſinne, though not inſtituted till Chriſt roſe again. No other cure for it. Infants of Chriſtians may be Diſciples, are holy. The effect of Circumciſion under the Law, inferreth the effect of Baptiſm under the Goſpel.

      * CHAP. VIII. What is alleadged to impeach Tradition for baptizing Infants; Proves not, that any could be ſaved regularly, who dyed unbaptized; but, that, baptizing at yeares was a ſtrong means to make good Chriſtians. Why the Church now Baptize, Infants. What becomes of Infants dying unbaptized, unanſwerable. What thoſe Infants g•t who dye baptized.

      * CHAP. IX. What controverſie the Reformation hath with the Church of Rome about Penance. Inward repentance that is ſincere, obtaineth pardon alone. Remiſſion of ſinnes by the Goſpel onely: The condition of it by the Miniſtrey of the Church. What the power of binding and looſing contains more then Preaching, or taking away offenſes. Sinne may be pardoned without the uſe of it. Wherein the neceſſity of uſing it lyeth.

      * CHAP. X. The Sects of the Montaniſts, Novations, Donatiſts, and Meletians, evidence the cure of ſinne by Penance, to be a Tradition of the Apoſtles. So doth the agreement of primitive practice with their writings. Indulgence of regular Penance from the Apoſtles. Confeſſion of ſecret ſinnes in the Primitive Church. That no ſinne can be cured without the Keyes of the Church, there is no Tradition from the Apoſtles. The neceſſity of confeſſing ſecret ſinnes, whereupon it ſtands.

      * CHAP. IX. Penance is not required to redeem tho debt of temporall puniſhment when the ſinne is pardoned. What aſſurance of forgiveneſſe, the law of auricular Confeſſion, as it is uſed in the Church of Rome, procureth Of injoyning Penance, after abſolution performed. Setting aſide abuſes, the Law is agreeable to Gods. Of the order taken by the Church of England.

      * CHAP. XI. The Unction of the ſick pretendeth onely bodily health, upon ſuppoſition of the cure of ſinne by the Keyes of the Church. Objections anſwered. The Tradition of the Church evidenceth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XII. The ground of the Right of the Church in Matrimonial cauſes. Mariage of one with one inſolubly is a Law of Chriſtianity; The Law of Moſes not injoyning it. The Law of the Empire not aiming at the ground of it. Evidence from the primitive practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XIV. Scripture alleged to prove the bond of Mariage inſoluble in caſe of adultery, uneffectuall. S. Paul and our Lord ſpeak both to one purpoſe, according to S. Jerome, and S. Auſtine. The contrary opinion more reaſonable, and more general in the Church. Why the Church may reſtrain the innocent party from marying again. The Imperial Lawes could never be of force to void the Power of the Church. Evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIV. Another opinion, admitting the ground of lawfull Impediments. What Impediments ariſe upon the Conſtitution of the Church, generally as a Society, or particularly, as of Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XVI. Of the Power of making Gouernours and Miniſters of the Church. Upon what ground the Hierarchy of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons ſtandeth, in oppoſition to Presbyteries and Congregations. Of the Power of Confirming, and the evidence of the Hierarchy which it yieldeth. Of thoſe Scriptures which ſeem to ſpeak of Presbyteries or Congregations.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power given the XII. under the Title of Apoſtles, and the LXX. Diſciples. That the VII were Deacons. Of the firſt Presbyters at Jeruſalem, and the Intereſt of the People. Presbyters appropriated to Churches, under the Apoſtles. S. Pauls Deacons no Presbyters. No ground for Lay Flders.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The Apoſtles all of oequall power; S. Peter onely chiefe in managing it. The ground for the pre-•minence of Churches, before and over Churches. Of Alexandria, Antiochia, Jeruſalem and Rome. Ground for the pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, before all Churches. The conſequence of that Ground. A ſummary of the evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XX. Of the conſtitution and authority of Councils. The ground of the pre-eminences of Churches in the Romane Empire. The VI. Canon of the Council of Nicaea. The pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, and that of Conſtantinople. Some inſtances againſt the ſuperiority of Biſhops, out of the records of the Church; what offices every Order by Gods Law, or by Canon Law, miniſtreth.

      * CHAP. XXI. Of the times of God ſervice; By what Title of his Law the firſt day of the week is kept Holy. How the Sabbath is to be ſanctified by Moſes Law.

Of the difference of meats, and meaſure of Faſting. Of the keeping o four Lords Birthday, and other Feſtivals, and the regular hours of the day for Gods ſervice.

      * CHAP. XXII. The people of God •ied to build Synagogues, though not by the leter of the Law. The Church to provide Churches, though the Scripture command it not. Preſcribing the form of Gods publick ſervice, is not quenching the Spirit. The Pſalter is preſcribed the Church for Gods Praiſes. The Scriptures preſcribed to be read in the Church; The Order of reading them to be preſcribed by the Church.

      * CHAP. XXIII. The conſideration of the Euchariſt preſcribed by Tradition, for the mater of it. Lords Prayer preſcribed in all ſervices. The mater of Prayers for all eſtates preſcribed. The form of Baptiſm neceſſary to be preſcribed. The ſame reaſon holdeth in the forms of other Offices.

      * CHAP. XXX. To worſhip Chriſt in the Euchariſt, though believing tranſubstantiation, is not Idolatry. Ground for the honour of Saints and Martyrs. The Saints and the Angels pray for us. Three ſorts of prayers to Saints: The firſt, agreeable with Chriſtianity: The laſt may be Idolatry: The ſecond a ſtep to it. Of the Reliques of the Saints Bodies. What the ſecond Commandement prohibiteth or alloweth. The ſecond Councile of Nicea doth not decree Idolatry; And yet there is no decree in the Church for the worſhiping of Images.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ground for a Monaſticall life in the Scriptures; And in the practice of the primitive Church. The Church getteth no peculiar intereſt in them who profeſſe it, by their profeſſing of it. The nature and intent of it renders it ſubordinate to the Clergy. How farre the ſingle life of the Clergy hath been a Law to the Church. Inexecution of the Canons for it. Nullity of the proceeddings of the Church of Rome in it. The intereſt of the People in the acts of the Church; And in the uſe of the Scriptures.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How great the Power of the Church, and the effect of it is. The right of judging the cauſes of Chriſtians c•aſeth, when it is protected by the State. An Objection; If Eccl•ſiaſticall Power were from God, Secular Power could not limit the uſe of it. Ground for the Intereſt of the State in Church matters. The inconſequence of the argument. The concurrence of both Intereſts to the Law of the Church. The Intereſt of the State in the indowment of the Church. Concurrence of both in matrimoniall cauſes, and Ordinations. Temporall penalties upon Excommunication from the State. No Soveraigne ſubject to the greater Excommunication, but to the leſſe. The Rights of the Jewes State and of Chriſtian Powers, in Religion, partly the ſame, partly not. The infinite Power of the Pope not founded upon acts of Epiſcopacy, but upon the Secular Powers of Chriſtendome.

1. OF THE LAWES OF The Church.

    _ The Firſt BOOK.

      * CHAP. I. All agree, that Reaſon is to decide controverſies of Faith. The objection, that Faith is taught by Gods Spirit, anſwered. What Reaſon decideth queſtions of Faith. The reſolution of Faith ends not in the light of Reaſon, but in that which Reaſon evidenceth to come from Gods meſſengers.

      * CHAP. II. The queſtion between the Scripture and the Church, which of them is Judge in matters of Faith. Whether opinion, the Tradition of the Church ſtands better with. Thoſe that hold the Scripture to be clear in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, have no reaſon to exclude the Tradition of the Church. What opinions they are, that deny the Church to be a Society or Corporation by Gods Law.

      * CHAP. III. That neither the ſentence of the Church, nor the dictate of Gods Spirit, can be the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be received. No man can know that hee hath Gods Spirit, without knowing that hee is a true Chriſtian; Which ſuppoſeth the truth of the Scripture. The motives of Faith are the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be believed: And the conſent of Gods people the reaſon that evidences thoſe motives to be infallibly true. How the Scriptures are believed for themſelves. How a Circle is made in rendering a reaſon of the Faith. The Scriptures are Gods Law to all, to whom they are publiſhed, by Gods act of publiſhing them; But Civil Law, by the act of Soveraign Powers, in acting Chriſtianity upon their Subjects.

      * CHAP. IV. Neither the Dictate of Gods Spirit nor the authority of the Church is the reaſon of believing any thing in Chriſtianity. Whether the Church be before the Scripture, or the Scripture before the Church. The Scriptures contain not the Infallibility of the Church. Nor the conſent of all Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. V. All things neceſſary to ſalvation are not clear in the Scriptures to all underſtandings. Not in the Old Teſtament. Not in the Goſpel. Not in the Writings of the Apoſtles. It is neceſſary to ſalvation to believe more than this, that our Lord is the Chriſt. Time cauſeth obſcurity in the Scriptures, aſwell as in other Records. That it is no where ſaid in the Scriptures, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are clear in the Scriptures. Neither is there any conſent of all Chriſtians to evidence the ſame.

      * CHAP. VI. All interpretation of Scripture is to be confined within the Tradition of the Church. This ſuppoſeth that the Church is a Communion inſtituted by God. What means there is to make evidence of Gods Charter, upon which the Corporation of the Church ſubſiſteth. The name of the Church, in the Scriptures, often ſignifieth the Whole or Cathelick Church.

      * CHAP. VII. That the Apoſtles delivered to the Church a Summary of Chriſtianity, which, all ſhould be baptized were to profeſs. Evidence out of the Scriptures. Evidence out of the Scriptures for Tradition regulating the Communion of the Church, and the Order of it. Evidence for the Rule of Faith, out of the records of the Church. For the Canons of the Church, and the pedegree of them from the Order eſtabliſhed in the Church by the Apoſtles. That the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and that by being baptized, is neceſſary to the ſalvation of a Chriſtian.

      * CHAP. VIII. That the Power of Governing the whole Church was in the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, and thoſe whom they took to aſſiſt them in the parts of it. The Power of their Succeſſors muſt needs be derived from thoſe. Why that Succeſſion which appeares in one Church, neceſſarily holdeth all Churches. The holding of Councils evidenceth the Ʋnity of the Church.

      * CHAP. IX. The Keyes of the Church given the Apoſtles, and exerciſed by Excommunication under the Apoſtles. The ground thereof is that profeſſion, which, all that are baptized are to make. That Penance and abatemeut of Penance hath been in force ever ſince and under the Apoſtles. In particular, of excluding Hereticks.

      * CHAP. X. Evidence of the Apoſtles act from the effect of it, in preſerving the Ʋnity of the Church. Of the buſineſſe of Marcion and Montanus. That about keeping Eaſter. That of the Novations, of rebaptizing Hereticks, of Paulus Samoſatenus, of Dionyſius Alexandrinus, and Arius. Of communicatory leters, and the intercourſe of the Church under and after the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. XI.Ʋpon what grounds the firſt book de Synedriis holds that the Church cannot excommunicate. Before the Law there was no ſuch Power, nor by it. Chriſtians went for Jewes under the Apoſtles. His ſenſe of ſome Scriptures. What the Leviatha• ſaith in general concerning the Power of the Church. Both ſuppoſe that Eccleſiaſtical Power includeth Temporal, which is not true. Of the Oxford Doctors Paraeneſis.

      * CHAP. XII. That the Law experſly covenanted for the Land of Promiſe. A great Objection againſt this, from the Great precept of the Law. The hope of the world to come under the Law, and the obedience which it requireth, was grounded upon reaſon from the true God, the Tradition of the Fathers, and the Doctrine of the Prophets. The Love of God above all by the Law extendeth no further than the precepts of the Law, the love of our Neighbor onely to Jewes. Of the Ceremonial, Judicial and Moral Law.

      * CHAP. XIII. That the Law tendreth no other promiſe but that of the Land of Canaan. How the Reſurrection is ſignified by the Prophets. Expreſſe texts of the Apoſtles. Their arguments, and the arguments of our Lord do ſuppoſe the myſtical ſenſe of the Scriptures. That this ſenſe is to be made good throughout the Scripture, whereſoever the ground of it takes place; Chriſtianity well grounded ſuppoſing this. What parts of Scripture may be queſtionable, whether they have a myſtical ſenſe or not. The ſayings and doings of our Lord have it; As alſo thoſe paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which are fulfilled by the ſame. The ſenſe of the Fathers.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Leviathans opin•on, that Chriſt came to reſtore that kingdome of God which the Jewes caſt off when they rejected Samuel. It overthroweth the foundation of Chriſtianity. The true Government of Gods ancient people. The name of the Church in the New Teſtament cannot ſignifie the Synagogue. Nor any Chriſtian State.

      * CHAP. XV. How the Power of the Church is founded upon the Law. The Power of the Kingdome, Prieſthood, Prophets, and Rulers of that people all of divine right. How farre theſe qualities and the powers of them are to continue in the Church. The ſenſe of the Fathers in this point. That the acts of S. Paul and the reſt of the Apoſtles were not of force by virtue of the Law. What Eccleſiaſtical Power ſhould have been among the Jewes, in caſe they had received the Goſpel, and ſo the State had ſtood.

      * CHAP. XVI. The Church founded upon the Power given the Apoſtles. What is the ſubject mater of Church Lawes. The right of the Church to Tithes and Oblations is not grounded upon the Law, though evidenced by it, and by practice of the Patriarchs. Evidence of the Apoſtles Order in the Scriptures. The Church of Jeruſalem held not community of Goods. The original practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power of Excommunication in the Church is not founded in the Law. What argument there is of it in the Old Teſtament. The allegorical ſenſe thereof is argumentative. It was not neceſſary that the Chriſtians ſhould incurre perſecution for uſing the Power of the Keyes, and not by virtue of the Law.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The difference between S. Pauls anathema and that of the Jewes. It is not neceſſary that the Chriſtians anathema ſhould ſignifie curſing. That the inceſtuous perſon at Corinth was Excommunicated by S. Paul. Juriſdiction of the Church. Telling the Church, binding and looſing, holding him that is bound for a Heathen or a Publicane, ſigniſie the ſame. The coherence of our Lords diſcourſe. Of Excommunication and Indulgence by private perſons in the Ancient Church. That Excommunication and the Power of the Church could not come in force by the voluntary conſent of the firſt Chriſtians. How it may be ſaid to be voluntary. Of the confederacy of the primitive Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XIX. That Power which was in Churches under the Apoſtles, can never be in any Chriſtian Soveraign. The difference between the Church and the Synagogue in that regard. The intereſt of Secular Power in determining maters of Faith preſuppoſeth the Society of the Church, and the act of it. No man can be bound to profeſſe the contrary of that which hee believeth. Every man is bound to profeſſe that Chriſtianity which hee believeth. The Church is the chief Teacher of Chriſtianity through Chriſtendom, as the Soveraign of Civil Peace, thorough his Dominions. Why the Church is to decide maters of Faith rather than the State, neither being infallible.

      * CHAP. XX. The reſt of the Oxford Doctors pretenſe. The Power of binding and looſing ſuppoſeth not onely the Preaching of the Goſpel, but the outward act of Faith. Chriſtians are not at liberty to caſt themſelves into what formes of Churches the Law of Nature alloweth. They are Judges in chief for themſelves in mater of Religion, ſuppoſing the Catholick Church; not otherwiſe. Secular Power cannot puniſh for Religion, but ſuppoſing the act of the Church, nor do any act to inforce Religion, unleſſe the Church determine the mater of it.

      * CHAP. XXI. How the Tradition of the Church limits the interpretation of Scriptures. How the declaration of the Church becomes a reaſonable mark of Hereſie. That which is not found in the Scriptures may have been delivered by the Apoſtles. Some things delivered by the Apoſtles, and recorded in the Scriptures; may not oblige. S. Auſtines Rule of Apoſtolical Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Authority of the Fathers is not grounded upon any preſumption of their Learning or Holineſſe. How farr they challenge the credit of Hiſtorical truth. The pre-eminenee of the Primitive. The preſumption that is grounded upon their ranks and qualities in the Church. Of Arnobius, Lactantius, Tertullian, Origen, Clemens, and the approbation of poſterity.

      * CHAP. XXIII. Two inſtances againſt the premiſes, beſides the objection concerning the beginning of Antichriſt under the Apoſtles. The general anſwer to it. The ſeven Trumpets in the Apocalypſe fore-tell the deſtruction of the Jewes. The ſeven Vials, the plagues inflicted upon the Empire for the ten perſecutions. The correſpondence of Deniels Propheſie inferreth the ſame. Neither S. Pauls Prophe••e nor S. Johns concerneth any Chriſtian. Neither the opinion of the Chiliaſts, nor the giving of the Euchariſt to Infants new Baptized, Catholick.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Two ſorts of means to reſolve whatſoever is reſolvable concerning the Scripture. Upon what terms the Church may, or is to determine controverſies of Faith. And what obligation that determination produceth. Traditions of the Apoſtles oblige the preſent Church, as the reaſons of them continue or not. Inſtances in our Lords Paſſeover and Euchariſt. Penance under the Apoſtles, and afterwards. S. Pauls vail, eating blood, and things offered to Idols. The power of the Church in limiting theſe Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXV. The power of the Church in limiting even the Traditions of the Apoſtles. Not every abuſe of this power, a ſufficient warrant for particular Churches to reforme themſelves. Hereſie conſiſts in denying ſomething, neceſſary to ſalvation to be believed. Schiſm, in departing from the unity of the Church, whether upon that, or any other cauſe. Implicite Faith no virtue; but the effect of it may be the work of Chriſtian charity.

      * CHAP. XXVI. What it is to adde to Gods Law; What to adde the Apocalypſe. S. Pauls Anathema. The Beraeans. S. Johns Goſpel ſufficient to make one believe; and the Scriptures, The man of God perfit. How the Law giveth light, and Chriſtians are taught by God. How Idolatry is ſaid, not to be commanded by God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. Why it was death to tranſgreſs the determinations of the Jews Conſiſtory, and what power this argueth in the Church. A difference between the authority of the Apoſtles, and that of the Church. The being of the Church to the worlds end, with power of the Keyes, makes it not infallible. Obedience to Superiors, and the Pillar of truth inferre it not.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The Fathers acknowledge the Sufficience and clearneſs of the Scriptures, as, the Traditions of the Church. They are to be reconciled, by limiting the terms which they uſe. The limitation of thoſe ſayings which make all Chriſtian truth to be contained in the Scriptures. Of thoſe which make the authority of the Church the ground of Faith.

      * CHAP. XXXII. Anſwer to an Objection, that choice of Religion becomes difficult upon theſe terms. This reſolution is for the Intereſt of the Reformation. Thoſe that make the Church Infallible cannot, thoſe that make the Scripture clear and ſufficient may own Tradition for evidence to determine the meaning of the Scriptures, and Controverſies of Faith. The Intereſt of the Church of England. The pretenſe of Ruſhworthes Dialogues, that wee have no unqueſtionable Scripture, and, that the Tradition of the Church never changes.

      * CHAP. XXXI. That the Scriptures which wee have are unqueſtionable. That miſtakes in Copying are not conſiderable to the ſenſe and effect of them. The meaning of the Hebrew and Greek, even of the Prophets, determinable, to the deciding of Controverſies. How Religion delivered by Tradition becomes ſubject to be corrupted.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. The Diſpute concerning the Canon of Scripture, and the tranſlations thereof, in two Queſtions. There can be no Tradition for thoſe books that were written ſince Propheſie ceaſed. Wherein the excellence of them above other books lies. The chief objections againſt them are queſtionable. In thoſe parcels of the New Teſtament that have been queſtioned, the caſe is not the ſame. The ſenſe of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Onely the Original Copy can be Authentick. But, the truth thereof may as well be found in the tranſlations of the Old Teſtament, as in the Jewes Copies. The Jewes have not falſified them of malice. The Points come neither from Moſes, nor Eſdras, but from the Talmud Jewes.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. Of the anci•n eſt Tranſlations of the Bible into Greek firſt; With the Authors and authority of the ſame; Then into the Chaldee, Syriack, and Latine. Exceptions againſt the Greek, and the Samaritane Pentateuch. They are helps nevertheleſs to aſſure the true reading of the Scriptures, though with other Copies; whether Jewiſh or Chriſtian. Though the Vulgar Latine were better than the preſent Greek, yet muſt both depend upon the Original Greek of the New Teſta•ent. No danger to Chriſtianity by the differences remaining in the Bible.

      * CHAP. 1. Two parts of that which remains. How the diſpute concerning the Holy Trinity with Socinus belongs to the firſt. The Queſtion of juſtification by Faith alone. The Opinion of Socinus concerning the whole Covenant of Grace. The opinion of thoſe who make juſtifying Faith the knowledge of a mans Predeſtination, oppoſite to it in the other extream. The difference between it and that of the Antinomians. That there are mean Opinions.

      * CHAP. II. Evidence what is the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. The contract of Baptiſm. The promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt annexed to Chriſts, not to Johns Baptiſm. Thoſe are made Chriſts Diſciples as Chriſtians that take up his Croſſe in Baptiſm. The effects of Baptiſm according to the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. III. The exhortations of the Apoſtles, that are drawn from the patterns of the Old Teſtament, ſuppoſe the ſame. How the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament are the ſame, how not the ſame. How the New Teſtament and the New Covenant are both one. The free-will of man acteth the ſame part in dealing about the New-Covenant, as about the Old. The Gospel a Law.

      * CHAP. IV. The conſent of the whole Church evidenced by the cuſtome of chatechiſing. By the opinion thereof concerning the ſalvation of thoſe that delayed their Baptiſm. By the rites and Ceremonies of Baptiſm. Why no penance for ſins before, but after Baptiſm. The doctrine of the Church of England evident in this caſe.

      * CHAP. V. The Preaching of our Lord and his Apoſtles evidenceth, that ſome act of Mans free choice is the condition which it requireth. The correspondence betwen the Old and New Teſtament inferreth the ſame. So do the errors of Socinians and Antinomians concerning the neceſſity of Baptiſm. Objections deferred.

      * CHAP. VI. Juſtifying Faith ſometimes conſiſts in believing the truth. Sometimes, in truſt in God grounded upon the truth. Somtimes in Chriſtianity, that is in imbracing and profeſſing it. And that in the Fathers as well as in the Scriptures. Of the informed and formed Faith of the Schools.

      * CHAP. VII. The laſt ſignification of Faith is properly justifying Faith. The firſt by a Metonymy of the cauſe: The ſecond of the effect. Thoſe that are not juſtified doe truly believe. The truſt of a Chriſtian preſuppoſeth him to be juſtified. All the promiſes of the Goſpel become due at once by the Covenant of Grace. That, to believe that we are Elect or Juſtified, is not Justifying Faith.

      * CHAP. VIII. The objection from S. Paul; We are not juſtified by the Law nor by Workes, but by Grace and by Faith. Not meant of the Goſpel, and the workes that ſuppoſe it. The queſtion that S. Paul ſpeakes to, is of the Law of Moſes and the Workes of it. He ſets thoſe workes in the ſame rank with the workes of the Gentils by the light of nature. The civil and outward workes of the Law may be done by Gentiles. How the Law is a Pedagogue to Chriſt.

      * CHAP. IX. Of the Faith and Juſtification of Abraham and the Patriarkes, according to the Apoſtles. Of the Prophets and righteous men under the Law. Abraham and Rahab the harlot juſtified by workes, if juſtified by Faith. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend upon works which the Goſpell injoyneth. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. X. What Pelagius queſtioneth concerning the Grace of Chriſt, what Socinus further of the ſtate of Chriſt before his birth. The oppoſition between the firſt and ſecond Adam in S. Paul, evidenceth originall ſinne. Coucupiſcence in the unregenerate, and the inability of the Law to ſubdue it, evict the ſame. The ſecond birth by the holy Ghoſt evidenceth that the first birth propagateth ſinne.

      * CHAP. X. The Old Teſtament chargeth all men as well as the wicked to be ſinfull from the wombe. David complaineth of himſelfe as born in ſinne, no leſſe then the Wiſe man of the children of the Gentiles. How Leviticall Lawes argue the ſame. And temporall death under the Old Teſtament. The book of Wiſdome and the Greek Bible.

      * CHAP. XII. The Haereſie of Simon Magus the beginning of the Gnoſticks. That they were in being during the Apoſtles time. Where and when the Haereſie of Cerinthus prevailed, and, that they were Gnoſticks. The beginning of the Encratites under the Apostles. It is evident that one God in Trinity was then glorified among the Christians, by the Fullneſſe of the Godhead which they introduced in ſtead of it.

      * CHAP. XIII. The Word was at the beginning of all things. The apparitions of the Old Teſtament Prefaces to the Incarnation of Chriſt. Ambaſſadors are not honoured with the honour due to their Maſters. The Word of God that was afterwards incarnate was in thoſe Angels that ſpoke in Gods Name. No Angel honoured as God under the New Teſtament. The Word was with God at the beginning of all things, as after his return.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Name of God not aſcribed to Chriſt for the like reaſon as to creatures. The reaſons why the Socinians worſhip Chriſt as God do confute their limitations. Chriſt not God by virtue of his riſing againe. He is the Great God with S. Paul, the true God, with S. John, the onely Lord, with S. Jude. Other Scriptures. Of the forme of God, and of a ſervant in S. Paul.

      * CHAP. XV. Not onely the Church but the World was made by Chriſt. The Word was made fleſh in oppoſition to the Spirit. How the Prophets, how Chriſtians, by receiving the Word of God, are poſſeſſed by his Spirit. How the title of Sonne of God importeth the Godhead. How Chriſt is the brightneſſe and Image of God.

      * CHAP. XVI. The teſtimonies of Chriſts Godhead in the Old Teſtament are firſt underſtood of the figures of Chriſt. Of the Wiſdome of God in Solomon and elſewhere. Of the writings of the Jewes as well before as after Chriſt.

      * CHAP. XVII. Anſwer to thoſe texts of Scripture that ſeem to abate the true Godhead in Chriſt. Of that creature whereof Chriſt is the firſt-borne, and that which the Wiſdome of God made. That this beliefe is the originall Tradition of the Church. What meanes this diſpute furniſheth us with againſt the Arrians. That it is reaſon to ſubmit to revelation concerning the nature of God. The uſe of reaſon is no way renounced by holding this Faith.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The neceſſity of the grace of Chriſt, is the evidence of originall ſinne. How the exaltation of our Lord depends upon his humiliation, and the grace of Christ upon that▪ All the work of Chriſtianity is aſcribed to the grace of Chriſt. Gods predeſtination manifeſteth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XIX. Evidences of the ſame in the Old Teſtament; Of Gods help in getting the Land of Promiſe, and renewing the Covenant: And that for Chriſts ſake. That Chriſtianity cannot ſtand without acknowledging the grace of Chriſt. The Tradition of the Church; In the Baptiſme of Infants: In the Prayers of the Church; In the decrees against Pelagius and other records of the Church.

      * CHAP. XX. Wherein Originall ſinne conſiſteth; What opinions are on foot. That it is not Adams ſinne imputed to his poſterity. Whether man were at the firſt created to a ſupernaturall end, or not. An eſtate of meer nature, but innocent, poſſible. Originall ſinne is Concupiſcence. How Baptiſme voids it. Concerning the late novelty in the Church of England about Originall ſinne.

      * CHAP. XXI. The opinion that mak•s the Predetermination of mans will by God the ſourſe of his freedom; And wherein Janſenius differs from it. Of neceſsity upon ſuppoſition & abſolute. The neceſsity of the Will following the last dictate of the underſtanding is onely upon ſuppoſition, As alſo that which Gods foreſight creates. The difference between indifferent and undetermined.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Goſpel findeth man free from neceſſity, though not from bondage. Of the Antecedent and Conſequent Will of God. Praedetermination not the root, but the rooting up of Freedome and of Chriſtianity. Againſt the opinion of Janſenius.

      * CHAP. XXIII. A man is able to doe things truely honeſt under Originall ſin. But not to make God the end of all his doings. How all the actions of the Gentiles are ſins. They are accountable onely for the Law of nature. How all men have or have not Grace ſufficient to ſave.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Though God determineth not the will immediately, yet he determineth the effect thereof by the meanes of his providence, preſenting the object ſo as he foreſees it will chuſe, The caſes of Pharoah, of Solomon, of Ahab, and of the Jewes that crucified Chriſt. Of Gods foreknowledg of future conditionalls that come not to paſſe. The ground of foreknowledg of future contingencies. Difficult objections anſwered.

      * CHAP. XXV. The grounds of the difference between ſufficient and effectuall. How naturall occaſions, conduce to ſupernaturall actions, The inſufficience of Janſenius his doctrine. Of ſufficient grace under the Law of Moſes and Nature.

      * CHAP. XXVI. Predeſtination to grace abſolute, to glory reſpective: Purpoſe of denying effectuall Grace abſolute, of puniſhing reſpective. The end, to which God predeſtinates, is not the end for which he predeſtinates. Grace the reward of the right uſe of Grace. How much of the queſtion the Goſpell determines not. That our indeavours are ingaged no leſſe, then if predeſtination were not, it determineth. Of the Tradition of the Church; and of Semipelagians, Predeſtinatians and Arminians.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The queſtion concerning the ſatisfaction of Chriſt with Socinus. The reaſon why Sacrifices are figures of Chriſt, common to all ſacrifices. Why, and what Sacrifices the Fathers had, what the Law added. Of our ranſom by the price of Chriſts propitiatory Sacrifice.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Chriſt took away our ſinne by bearing the puniſhment of it. The Propheſie of Eſay LIII. We are reconciled to God by the Goſpel, in conſideration of Chriſts obedience. The reconcilement of Jews and Gentiles, Men and Angels, conſequent to the ſame. Of purging and expiating ſinne by Chriſt, and making propitiation for it. Of Chriſts dying for us.

      * CHAP. XXIX. The grant of Grace, in conſideration of Chriſt, ſuppoſes ſatisfaction made by him for ſinne. Neither our ſinnes imputable to Chriſt, nor his ſufferings to us, formally and perſonally, but, as the meritorious cauſes which ſatisfaction anſwereth. The effect of it, the Covenant of Grace, as well as help to performe it. The Fathers ſaved by the Faith of Chriſt to come. The Goſpel a new Law. The property of Satisfaction and Puniſhment in Chriſts ſufferings. Of the ſenſe of the Catholike Church.

      * CHAP. XXX. God might have reconciled man to himſelf without the coming of Chriſt. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend as well upon his active as paſſive obedience. Chriſt need not ſuffer •ell pa•nes that we might not. The opinion that maketh juſtifying Faith to be truſt in God not true; Yet not prejudiciall to the Faith. The decree of the Council of Trent, and the doctrine of the Schoole; how it is not prejudiciall to the Faith. As alſo that of Socinus.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ſtate of the queſtion concerning the perſeverance of thoſe that are once juſtified. Of three ſenſes, one true, one inconſiſtent with the Faith, the third neither true nor yet deſtructive to the Faith. Evidence from the writings of the Apoſtles. From the Old Teſtament. The grace of Propheſie when it preſuppoſeth ſanctifying grace. Anſwer to ſome Texts, and of S. Pauls meaning in the VII. of the Romans. Of the Polygamy of the Fathers. What aſſurance of Grace Chriſtians may have. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How the fullfilling of Gods Law is poſſible, how impoſſible▪ for a Chriſtian. Of the difference between mortall and v•niall ſinne. What love of God and of our neighbour was neceſſary under the Old Teſtament. Whether the S•rmon in the Mount correct the falſe interpretation of the Jewes, or inhanſe the obligation of the Law. Of the difference between matter of Precept and matter of Counſail; and the Perfection of Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Whether any workes of Chriſtians be ſatisfactory for ſinne, and meritorious of heaven, or not. The recovery of Gods grace for a Chriſtian fallen from it, a work of labour and time. The neceſſity and efficacy of Penance to that purpoſe, according to the Scriptures, and the practiſe of the Church. Merit by virtue of Gods promiſe, neceſſary. The Catholicke Church agrees in it, the preſent Church of Rome allowes merit of juſtice▪

      * CHAP. I. The Society of the Church founded upon the duty of communicating in the Offices of Gods Service. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt, among thoſe Offices, proper to Chriſtianity. What opinions, concerning the preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood in the Euchariſt, are on foot.

      * CHAP. II. That the natural ſubſtance of the Elements remains in the Sacrament. That the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is nevertheleſſe preſent in the ſame, when it is received, not by the receiving of it. The eating of the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe neceſſarily requireth the ſame. This cauſes no contradiction nor improperty in the words of our Lord.

      * CHAP. III. That the preſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt depends not upon the living Faith of him that receives, but upon the true profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the Church that celebrates. The Scriptures that are alleged for the dependence of it upon the communication of the properties. They conclude not the ſenſe of them by whom they are alleged. How the Scripture confineth the fleſh of Chriſt to the Heavens.

      * CHAP. IV. The opinion which maketh the Conſecration to be done by rehearſing the operative words. That our Lord conſecrated by Thanksgiving. The Form of it in all Liturgies, together with the conſent of the Fathers. Evidence, that there is no Tradition of the Church for the aboliſhing of the Elements.

      * CHAP. V. It cannot be proved by the Old Teſtament that the Euchariſt is a Sacrifice. How, by the New Teſtament it may be ſo accounted. Four reaſons thereof, depending upon the nature of Juſtifying Faith premiſed. The conſent of the Catholick Church. The concurrence of the Church of England to the premiſes.

      * CHAP. VI. The reaſon of the Order by which I proceed, brings me to the Baptiſm of Infants in the next place. The power of the Keyes ſeen in granting Baptiſm, as well as in communicating the Euchariſt. Why Socinians make Baptiſm indifferent: Why Antinomians make it a miſtake to Baptize. The grounds upon which I ſhake off both: With anſwer to ſome objections.

      * CHAP. VII. The ground of baptizing Infants Originall ſinne, though not inſtituted till Chriſt roſe again. No other cure for it. Infants of Chriſtians may be Diſciples, are holy. The effect of Circumciſion under the Law, inferreth the effect of Baptiſm under the Goſpel.

      * CHAP. VIII. What is alleadged to impeach Tradition for baptizing Infants; Proves not, that any could be ſaved regularly, who dyed unbaptized; but, that, baptizing at yeares was a ſtrong means to make good Chriſtians. Why the Church now Baptize, Infants. What becomes of Infants dying unbaptized, unanſwerable. What thoſe Infants g•t who dye baptized.

      * CHAP. IX. What controverſie the Reformation hath with the Church of Rome about Penance. Inward repentance that is ſincere, obtaineth pardon alone. Remiſſion of ſinnes by the Goſpel onely: The condition of it by the Miniſtrey of the Church. What the power of binding and looſing contains more then Preaching, or taking away offenſes. Sinne may be pardoned without the uſe of it. Wherein the neceſſity of uſing it lyeth.

      * CHAP. X. The Sects of the Montaniſts, Novations, Donatiſts, and Meletians, evidence the cure of ſinne by Penance, to be a Tradition of the Apoſtles. So doth the agreement of primitive practice with their writings. Indulgence of regular Penance from the Apoſtles. Confeſſion of ſecret ſinnes in the Primitive Church. That no ſinne can be cured without the Keyes of the Church, there is no Tradition from the Apoſtles. The neceſſity of confeſſing ſecret ſinnes, whereupon it ſtands.

      * CHAP. IX. Penance is not required to redeem tho debt of temporall puniſhment when the ſinne is pardoned. What aſſurance of forgiveneſſe, the law of auricular Confeſſion, as it is uſed in the Church of Rome, procureth Of injoyning Penance, after abſolution performed. Setting aſide abuſes, the Law is agreeable to Gods. Of the order taken by the Church of England.

      * CHAP. XI. The Unction of the ſick pretendeth onely bodily health, upon ſuppoſition of the cure of ſinne by the Keyes of the Church. Objections anſwered. The Tradition of the Church evidenceth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XII. The ground of the Right of the Church in Matrimonial cauſes. Mariage of one with one inſolubly is a Law of Chriſtianity; The Law of Moſes not injoyning it. The Law of the Empire not aiming at the ground of it. Evidence from the primitive practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XIV. Scripture alleged to prove the bond of Mariage inſoluble in caſe of adultery, uneffectuall. S. Paul and our Lord ſpeak both to one purpoſe, according to S. Jerome, and S. Auſtine. The contrary opinion more reaſonable, and more general in the Church. Why the Church may reſtrain the innocent party from marying again. The Imperial Lawes could never be of force to void the Power of the Church. Evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIV. Another opinion, admitting the ground of lawfull Impediments. What Impediments ariſe upon the Conſtitution of the Church, generally as a Society, or particularly, as of Chriſtians. By what Law ſome degrees are prohibited Chriſtians. And, of the Polygamy of the Patriarchs. Mariage with the deceaſed wives Siſter, and with a Couſin Germane, by what Law prohibited.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power given the XII. under the Title of Apoſtles, and the LXX. Diſciples. That the VII were Deacons. Of the firſt Presbyters at Jeruſalem, and the Intereſt of the People. Presbyters appropriated to Churches, under the Apoſtles. S. Pauls Deacons no Presbyters. No ground for Lay Flders.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The Apoſtles all of oequall power; S. Peter onely chiefe in managing it. The ground for the pre-•minence of Churches, before and over Churches. Of Alexandria, Antiochia, Jeruſalem and Rome. Ground for the pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, before all Churches. The conſequence of that Ground. A ſummary of the evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIX. Of the proceedings about Marcion and Montanus at Rome. The buſineſse of Pope Victor about keeping Eaſter; a peremptory inſtance. The buſineſſe of the Novatians evidenceth the ſame. Of the buſineſſes concerning the rebaptizing of Hereticks, Dionyſius of Alexandria, Paulus Samoſatenus, S. Cypriane, and, of the Donatiſts under Conſtantine.

      * CHAP. XX. Of the conſtitution and authority of Councils. The ground of the pre-eminences of Churches in the Romane Empire. The VI. Canon of the Council of Nicaea. The pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, and that of Conſtantinople. Some inſtances againſt the ſuperiority of Biſhops, out of the records of the Church; what offices every Order by Gods Law, or by Canon Law, miniſtreth.

      * CHAP. XXI. Of the times of God ſervice; By what Title of his Law the firſt day of the week is kept Holy. How the Sabbath is to be ſanctified by Moſes Law.

Of the difference of meats, and meaſure of Faſting. Of the keeping o four Lords Birthday, and other Feſtivals, and the regular hours of the day for Gods ſervice.

      * CHAP. XXII. The people of God •ied to build Synagogues, though not by the leter of the Law. The Church to provide Churches, though the Scripture command it not. Preſcribing the form of Gods publick ſervice, is not quenching the Spirit. The Pſalter is preſcribed the Church for Gods Praiſes. The Scriptures preſcribed to be read in the Church; The Order of reading them to be preſcribed by the Church.

      * CHAP. XXIII. The conſideration of the Euchariſt preſcribed by Tradition, for the mater of it. Lords Prayer preſcribed in all ſervices. The mater of Prayers for all eſtates preſcribed. The form of Baptiſm neceſſary to be preſcribed. The ſame reaſon holdeth in the forms of other Offices.

      * CHAP. XXIV. The Service of God to be preſcribed in a known Language. No pretenſe that the Latine is now underſtood. The means to preſerve Unity in the Church, notwithſtanding. The true reaſon of a Sacrifice inforceth Communion in the Euchariſt. What occaſions may diſpenſe in it. Communion in both kindes commanded the People. Objections anſwered. Who is chargeable with the abuſe.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Prayer the more principall Office of Gods ſervice then Preaching. Preachings, neither Gods word, nor the meanes of ſalvation, unleſſe limited to the Faith of Gods Church. What, the edification of the Church by preaching further requires. The Order for Divine ſervice according to the courſe of the Church of England; According to the cuſtome of the univerſall Church.

      * CHAP. XXV. Idolatry preſuppoſeth an immagination that there is more Gods then one. Objections out of the ſcripture that it is the worſhip of a true God under an Image. the Originall of worſhipping the elements of the world: The Devil: And Images. Of the Idolatry of the Magicians, and of the Gnosticks. What Idolatry the caſes of Aron and of Jer•boam involve. Of the Idolatries practiſed under the Kings and Judges, in anſwer to objections.

      * CHAP. XXVI. The Place, or rather the State of happy and miſerable Soules otherwiſe underſtood by Gods people before Chriſts aſcenſion, then after it. What the Apocalypſe, what the reſt of the Apoſtles declare. Onely Martyrs before Gods Throne. Of the ſight of God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The Soules of the Fathers were not in the Devils Power till Chriſt; Though the Old Teſtament declare not their eſtate. Of Samuels ſoul. The ſoul of our Lord Chriſt, parting from his body, went with the Thiefe to Paradiſe. Of his triumph over the powers of darkneſſe. Prayer for the dead ſignifieth no delivering of ſoules out of Purgatory. The Covenant of Grace requires imperfect happineſſe before the generall judgement. Of forgiveneſſe in the world to come, and, paying the utmoſt farthing.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Ancient opinions in the Church, of the place of ſoules before the day of judgement. No Tradition that the Fathers were in the Ʋerge of Hell, under the Earth. The reaſon of the difference in the expreſſions of the Fathers of the Church. What Tradition of the Church for the place of Christs ſoule, during his death, The Saints ſoules in ſecret manſions, according to the Tradition of the Church. Prayer for the dead ſuppoſeth the ſame.

Three ſorts of prayers to Saints: The firſt, agreeable with Chriſtianity: The laſt may be Idolatry: The ſecond a ſtep to it. Of the Reliques of the Saints Bodies. What the ſecond Commandement prohibiteth or alloweth. The ſecond Councile of Nicea doth not decree Idolatry; And yet there is no decree in the Church for the worſhiping of Images.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ground for a Monaſticall life in the Scriptures; And in the practice of the primitive Church. The Church getteth no peculiar intereſt in them who profeſſe it, by their profeſſing of it. The nature and intent of it renders it ſubordinate to the Clergy. How farre the ſingle life of the Clergy hath been a Law to the Church. Inexecution of the Canons for it. Nullity of the proceeddings of the Church of Rome in it. The intereſt of the People in the acts of the Church; And in the uſe of the Scriptures.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How great the Power of the Church, and the effect of it is. The right of judging the cauſes of Chriſtians c•aſeth, when it is protected by the State. An Objection; If Eccl•ſiaſticall Power were from God, Secular Power could not limit the uſe of it. Ground for the Intereſt of the State in Church matters. The inconſequence of the argument. The concurrence of both Intereſts to the Law of the Church. The Intereſt of the State in the indowment of the Church. Concurrence of both in matrimoniall cauſes, and Ordinations.

The infinite Power of the Pope not founded upon acts of Epiſcopacy, but upon the Secular Powers of Chriſtendome.

    _ The ſecond BOOK.

      * CHAP. I. All agree, that Reaſon is to decide controverſies of Faith. The objection, that Faith is taught by Gods Spirit, anſwered. What Reaſon decideth queſtions of Faith. The reſolution of Faith ends not in the light of Reaſon, but in that which Reaſon evidenceth to come from Gods meſſengers.

      * CHAP. II. The queſtion between the Scripture and the Church, which of them is Judge in matters of Faith. Whether opinion, the Tradition of the Church ſtands better with. Thoſe that hold the Scripture to be clear in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, have no reaſon to exclude the Tradition of the Church. What opinions they are, that deny the Church to be a Society or Corporation by Gods Law.

      * CHAP. III. That neither the ſentence of the Church, nor the dictate of Gods Spirit, can be the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be received. No man can know that hee hath Gods Spirit, without knowing that hee is a true Chriſtian; Which ſuppoſeth the truth of the Scripture. The motives of Faith are the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be believed: And the conſent of Gods people the reaſon that evidences thoſe motives to be infallibly true. How the Scriptures are believed for themſelves. How a Circle is made in rendering a reaſon of the Faith. The Scriptures are Gods Law to all, to whom they are publiſhed, by Gods act of publiſhing them; But Civil Law, by the act of Soveraign Powers, in acting Chriſtianity upon their Subjects.

      * CHAP. IV. Neither the Dictate of Gods Spirit nor the authority of the Church is the reaſon of believing any thing in Chriſtianity. Whether the Church be before the Scripture, or the Scripture before the Church. The Scriptures contain not the Infallibility of the Church. Nor the conſent of all Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. V. All things neceſſary to ſalvation are not clear in the Scriptures to all underſtandings. Not in the Old Teſtament. Not in the Goſpel. Not in the Writings of the Apoſtles. It is neceſſary to ſalvation to believe more than this, that our Lord is the Chriſt. Time cauſeth obſcurity in the Scriptures, aſwell as in other Records. That it is no where ſaid in the Scriptures, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are clear in the Scriptures. Neither is there any conſent of all Chriſtians to evidence the ſame.

      * CHAP. VI. All interpretation of Scripture is to be confined within the Tradition of the Church. This ſuppoſeth that the Church is a Communion inſtituted by God. What means there is to make evidence of Gods Charter, upon which the Corporation of the Church ſubſiſteth. The name of the Church, in the Scriptures, often ſignifieth the Whole or Cathelick Church.

      * CHAP. VII. That the Apoſtles delivered to the Church a Summary of Chriſtianity, which, all ſhould be baptized were to profeſs. Evidence out of the Scriptures. Evidence out of the Scriptures for Tradition regulating the Communion of the Church, and the Order of it. Evidence for the Rule of Faith, out of the records of the Church. For the Canons of the Church, and the pedegree of them from the Order eſtabliſhed in the Church by the Apoſtles. That the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and that by being baptized, is neceſſary to the ſalvation of a Chriſtian.

      * CHAP. VIII. That the Power of Governing the whole Church was in the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, and thoſe whom they took to aſſiſt them in the parts of it. The Power of their Succeſſors muſt needs be derived from thoſe. Why that Succeſſion which appeares in one Church, neceſſarily holdeth all Churches. The holding of Councils evidenceth the Ʋnity of the Church.

      * CHAP. IX. The Keyes of the Church given the Apoſtles, and exerciſed by Excommunication under the Apoſtles. The ground thereof is that profeſſion, which, all that are baptized are to make. That Penance and abatemeut of Penance hath been in force ever ſince and under the Apoſtles. In particular, of excluding Hereticks.

      * CHAP. X. Evidence of the Apoſtles act from the effect of it, in preſerving the Ʋnity of the Church. Of the buſineſſe of Marcion and Montanus. That about keeping Eaſter. That of the Novations, of rebaptizing Hereticks, of Paulus Samoſatenus, of Dionyſius Alexandrinus, and Arius. Of communicatory leters, and the intercourſe of the Church under and after the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. XI.Ʋpon what grounds the firſt book de Synedriis holds that the Church cannot excommunicate. Before the Law there was no ſuch Power, nor by it. Chriſtians went for Jewes under the Apoſtles. His ſenſe of ſome Scriptures. What the Leviatha• ſaith in general concerning the Power of the Church. Both ſuppoſe that Eccleſiaſtical Power includeth Temporal, which is not true. Of the Oxford Doctors Paraeneſis.

      * CHAP. XII. That the Law experſly covenanted for the Land of Promiſe. A great Objection againſt this, from the Great precept of the Law. The hope of the world to come under the Law, and the obedience which it requireth, was grounded upon reaſon from the true God, the Tradition of the Fathers, and the Doctrine of the Prophets. The Love of God above all by the Law extendeth no further than the precepts of the Law, the love of our Neighbor onely to Jewes. Of the Ceremonial, Judicial and Moral Law.

      * CHAP. XIII. That the Law tendreth no other promiſe but that of the Land of Canaan. How the Reſurrection is ſignified by the Prophets. Expreſſe texts of the Apoſtles. Their arguments, and the arguments of our Lord do ſuppoſe the myſtical ſenſe of the Scriptures. That this ſenſe is to be made good throughout the Scripture, whereſoever the ground of it takes place; Chriſtianity well grounded ſuppoſing this. What parts of Scripture may be queſtionable, whether they have a myſtical ſenſe or not. The ſayings and doings of our Lord have it; As alſo thoſe paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which are fulfilled by the ſame. The ſenſe of the Fathers.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Leviathans opin•on, that Chriſt came to reſtore that kingdome of God which the Jewes caſt off when they rejected Samuel. It overthroweth the foundation of Chriſtianity. The true Government of Gods ancient people. The name of the Church in the New Teſtament cannot ſignifie the Synagogue. Nor any Chriſtian State.

      * CHAP. XV. How the Power of the Church is founded upon the Law. The Power of the Kingdome, Prieſthood, Prophets, and Rulers of that people all of divine right. How farre theſe qualities and the powers of them are to continue in the Church. The ſenſe of the Fathers in this point. That the acts of S. Paul and the reſt of the Apoſtles were not of force by virtue of the Law. What Eccleſiaſtical Power ſhould have been among the Jewes, in caſe they had received the Goſpel, and ſo the State had ſtood.

      * CHAP. XVI. The Church founded upon the Power given the Apoſtles. What is the ſubject mater of Church Lawes. The right of the Church to Tithes and Oblations is not grounded upon the Law, though evidenced by it, and by practice of the Patriarchs. Evidence of the Apoſtles Order in the Scriptures. The Church of Jeruſalem held not community of Goods. The original practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power of Excommunication in the Church is not founded in the Law. What argument there is of it in the Old Teſtament. The allegorical ſenſe thereof is argumentative. It was not neceſſary that the Chriſtians ſhould incurre perſecution for uſing the Power of the Keyes, and not by virtue of the Law.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The difference between S. Pauls anathema and that of the Jewes. It is not neceſſary that the Chriſtians anathema ſhould ſignifie curſing. That the inceſtuous perſon at Corinth was Excommunicated by S. Paul. Juriſdiction of the Church. Telling the Church, binding and looſing, holding him that is bound for a Heathen or a Publicane, ſigniſie the ſame. The coherence of our Lords diſcourſe. Of Excommunication and Indulgence by private perſons in the Ancient Church. That Excommunication and the Power of the Church could not come in force by the voluntary conſent of the firſt Chriſtians. How it may be ſaid to be voluntary. Of the confederacy of the primitive Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XIX. That Power which was in Churches under the Apoſtles, can never be in any Chriſtian Soveraign. The difference between the Church and the Synagogue in that regard. The intereſt of Secular Power in determining maters of Faith preſuppoſeth the Society of the Church, and the act of it. No man can be bound to profeſſe the contrary of that which hee believeth. Every man is bound to profeſſe that Chriſtianity which hee believeth. The Church is the chief Teacher of Chriſtianity through Chriſtendom, as the Soveraign of Civil Peace, thorough his Dominions. Why the Church is to decide maters of Faith rather than the State, neither being infallible.

      * CHAP. XX. The reſt of the Oxford Doctors pretenſe. The Power of binding and looſing ſuppoſeth not onely the Preaching of the Goſpel, but the outward act of Faith. Chriſtians are not at liberty to caſt themſelves into what formes of Churches the Law of Nature alloweth. They are Judges in chief for themſelves in mater of Religion, ſuppoſing the Catholick Church; not otherwiſe. Secular Power cannot puniſh for Religion, but ſuppoſing the act of the Church, nor do any act to inforce Religion, unleſſe the Church determine the mater of it.

      * CHAP. XXI. How the Tradition of the Church limits the interpretation of Scriptures. How the declaration of the Church becomes a reaſonable mark of Hereſie. That which is not found in the Scriptures may have been delivered by the Apoſtles. Some things delivered by the Apoſtles, and recorded in the Scriptures; may not oblige. S. Auſtines Rule of Apoſtolical Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Authority of the Fathers is not grounded upon any preſumption of their Learning or Holineſſe. How farr they challenge the credit of Hiſtorical truth. The pre-eminenee of the Primitive. The preſumption that is grounded upon their ranks and qualities in the Church. Of Arnobius, Lactantius, Tertullian, Origen, Clemens, and the approbation of poſterity.

      * CHAP. XXIII. Two inſtances againſt the premiſes, beſides the objection concerning the beginning of Antichriſt under the Apoſtles. The general anſwer to it. The ſeven Trumpets in the Apocalypſe fore-tell the deſtruction of the Jewes. The ſeven Vials, the plagues inflicted upon the Empire for the ten perſecutions. The correſpondence of Deniels Propheſie inferreth the ſame. Neither S. Pauls Prophe••e nor S. Johns concerneth any Chriſtian. Neither the opinion of the Chiliaſts, nor the giving of the Euchariſt to Infants new Baptized, Catholick.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Two ſorts of means to reſolve whatſoever is reſolvable concerning the Scripture. Upon what terms the Church may, or is to determine controverſies of Faith. And what obligation that determination produceth. Traditions of the Apoſtles oblige the preſent Church, as the reaſons of them continue or not. Inſtances in our Lords Paſſeover and Euchariſt. Penance under the Apoſtles, and afterwards. S. Pauls vail, eating blood, and things offered to Idols. The power of the Church in limiting theſe Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXV. The power of the Church in limiting even the Traditions of the Apoſtles. Not every abuſe of this power, a ſufficient warrant for particular Churches to reforme themſelves. Hereſie conſiſts in denying ſomething, neceſſary to ſalvation to be believed. Schiſm, in departing from the unity of the Church, whether upon that, or any other cauſe. Implicite Faith no virtue; but the effect of it may be the work of Chriſtian charity.

      * CHAP. XXVI. What it is to adde to Gods Law; What to adde the Apocalypſe. S. Pauls Anathema. The Beraeans. S. Johns Goſpel ſufficient to make one believe; and the Scriptures, The man of God perfit. How the Law giveth light, and Chriſtians are taught by God. How Idolatry is ſaid, not to be commanded by God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. Why it was death to tranſgreſs the determinations of the Jews Conſiſtory, and what power this argueth in the Church. A difference between the authority of the Apoſtles, and that of the Church. The being of the Church to the worlds end, with power of the Keyes, makes it not infallible. Obedience to Superiors, and the Pillar of truth inferre it not.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The Fathers acknowledge the Sufficience and clearneſs of the Scriptures, as, the Traditions of the Church. They are to be reconciled, by limiting the terms which they uſe. The limitation of thoſe ſayings which make all Chriſtian truth to be contained in the Scriptures. Of thoſe which make the authority of the Church the ground of Faith.

      * CHAP. XXXII. Anſwer to an Objection, that choice of Religion becomes difficult upon theſe terms. This reſolution is for the Intereſt of the Reformation. Thoſe that make the Church Infallible cannot, thoſe that make the Scripture clear and ſufficient may own Tradition for evidence to determine the meaning of the Scriptures, and Controverſies of Faith. The Intereſt of the Church of England. The pretenſe of Ruſhworthes Dialogues, that wee have no unqueſtionable Scripture, and, that the Tradition of the Church never changes.

      * CHAP. XXXI. That the Scriptures which wee have are unqueſtionable. That miſtakes in Copying are not conſiderable to the ſenſe and effect of them. The meaning of the Hebrew and Greek, even of the Prophets, determinable, to the deciding of Controverſies. How Religion delivered by Tradition becomes ſubject to be corrupted.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. The Diſpute concerning the Canon of Scripture, and the tranſlations thereof, in two Queſtions. There can be no Tradition for thoſe books that were written ſince Propheſie ceaſed. Wherein the excellence of them above other books lies. The chief objections againſt them are queſtionable. In thoſe parcels of the New Teſtament that have been queſtioned, the caſe is not the ſame. The ſenſe of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Onely the Original Copy can be Authentick. But, the truth thereof may as well be found in the tranſlations of the Old Teſtament, as in the Jewes Copies. The Jewes have not falſified them of malice. The Points come neither from Moſes, nor Eſdras, but from the Talmud Jewes.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. Of the anci•n eſt Tranſlations of the Bible into Greek firſt; With the Authors and authority of the ſame; Then into the Chaldee, Syriack, and Latine. Exceptions againſt the Greek, and the Samaritane Pentateuch. They are helps nevertheleſs to aſſure the true reading of the Scriptures, though with other Copies; whether Jewiſh or Chriſtian. Though the Vulgar Latine were better than the preſent Greek, yet muſt both depend upon the Original Greek of the New Teſta•ent. No danger to Chriſtianity by the differences remaining in the Bible.

      * CHAP. 1. Two parts of that which remains. How the diſpute concerning the Holy Trinity with Socinus belongs to the firſt. The Queſtion of juſtification by Faith alone. The Opinion of Socinus concerning the whole Covenant of Grace. The opinion of thoſe who make juſtifying Faith the knowledge of a mans Predeſtination, oppoſite to it in the other extream. The difference between it and that of the Antinomians. That there are mean Opinions.

      * CHAP. II. Evidence what is the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. The contract of Baptiſm. The promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt annexed to Chriſts, not to Johns Baptiſm. Thoſe are made Chriſts Diſciples as Chriſtians that take up his Croſſe in Baptiſm. The effects of Baptiſm according to the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. III. The exhortations of the Apoſtles, that are drawn from the patterns of the Old Teſtament, ſuppoſe the ſame. How the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament are the ſame, how not the ſame. How the New Teſtament and the New Covenant are both one. The free-will of man acteth the ſame part in dealing about the New-Covenant, as about the Old. The Gospel a Law.

      * CHAP. IV. The conſent of the whole Church evidenced by the cuſtome of chatechiſing. By the opinion thereof concerning the ſalvation of thoſe that delayed their Baptiſm. By the rites and Ceremonies of Baptiſm. Why no penance for ſins before, but after Baptiſm. The doctrine of the Church of England evident in this caſe.

      * CHAP. V. The Preaching of our Lord and his Apoſtles evidenceth, that ſome act of Mans free choice is the condition which it requireth. The correspondence betwen the Old and New Teſtament inferreth the ſame. So do the errors of Socinians and Antinomians concerning the neceſſity of Baptiſm. Objections deferred.

      * CHAP. VI. Juſtifying Faith ſometimes conſiſts in believing the truth. Sometimes, in truſt in God grounded upon the truth. Somtimes in Chriſtianity, that is in imbracing and profeſſing it. And that in the Fathers as well as in the Scriptures. Of the informed and formed Faith of the Schools.

      * CHAP. VII. The laſt ſignification of Faith is properly justifying Faith. The firſt by a Metonymy of the cauſe: The ſecond of the effect. Thoſe that are not juſtified doe truly believe. The truſt of a Chriſtian preſuppoſeth him to be juſtified. All the promiſes of the Goſpel become due at once by the Covenant of Grace. That, to believe that we are Elect or Juſtified, is not Justifying Faith.

      * CHAP. VIII. The objection from S. Paul; We are not juſtified by the Law nor by Workes, but by Grace and by Faith. Not meant of the Goſpel, and the workes that ſuppoſe it. The queſtion that S. Paul ſpeakes to, is of the Law of Moſes and the Workes of it. He ſets thoſe workes in the ſame rank with the workes of the Gentils by the light of nature. The civil and outward workes of the Law may be done by Gentiles. How the Law is a Pedagogue to Chriſt.

      * CHAP. IX. Of the Faith and Juſtification of Abraham and the Patriarkes, according to the Apoſtles. Of the Prophets and righteous men under the Law. Abraham and Rahab the harlot juſtified by workes, if juſtified by Faith. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend upon works which the Goſpell injoyneth. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. X. What Pelagius queſtioneth concerning the Grace of Chriſt, what Socinus further of the ſtate of Chriſt before his birth. The oppoſition between the firſt and ſecond Adam in S. Paul, evidenceth originall ſinne. Coucupiſcence in the unregenerate, and the inability of the Law to ſubdue it, evict the ſame. The ſecond birth by the holy Ghoſt evidenceth that the first birth propagateth ſinne.

      * CHAP. X. The Old Teſtament chargeth all men as well as the wicked to be ſinfull from the wombe. David complaineth of himſelfe as born in ſinne, no leſſe then the Wiſe man of the children of the Gentiles. How Leviticall Lawes argue the ſame. And temporall death under the Old Teſtament. The book of Wiſdome and the Greek Bible.

It is evident that one God in Trinity was then glorified among the Christians, by the Fullneſſe of the Godhead which they introduced in ſtead of it.

      * CHAP. XIII. The Word was at the beginning of all things. The apparitions of the Old Teſtament Prefaces to the Incarnation of Chriſt. Ambaſſadors are not honoured with the honour due to their Maſters. The Word of God that was afterwards incarnate was in thoſe Angels that ſpoke in Gods Name. No Angel honoured as God under the New Teſtament. The Word was with God at the beginning of all things, as after his return.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Name of God not aſcribed to Chriſt for the like reaſon as to creatures. The reaſons why the Socinians worſhip Chriſt as God do confute their limitations.

Of the forme of God, and of a ſervant in S. Paul.

      * CHAP. XV. Not onely the Church but the World was made by Chriſt. The Word was made fleſh in oppoſition to the Spirit. How the Prophets, how Chriſtians, by receiving the Word of God, are poſſeſſed by his Spirit. How the title of Sonne of God importeth the Godhead. How Chriſt is the brightneſſe and Image of God.

      * CHAP. XVI. The teſtimonies of Chriſts Godhead in the Old Teſtament are firſt underſtood of the figures of Chriſt. Of the Wiſdome of God in Solomon and elſewhere. Of the writings of the Jewes as well before as after Chriſt.

      * CHAP. XVII. Anſwer to thoſe texts of Scripture that ſeem to abate the true Godhead in Chriſt. Of that creature whereof Chriſt is the firſt-borne, and that which the Wiſdome of God made. That this beliefe is the originall Tradition of the Church. What meanes this diſpute furniſheth us with againſt the Arrians. That it is reaſon to ſubmit to revelation concerning the nature of God. The uſe of reaſon is no way renounced by holding this Faith.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The neceſſity of the grace of Chriſt, is the evidence of originall ſinne. How the exaltation of our Lord depends upon his humiliation, and the grace of Christ upon that▪ All the work of Chriſtianity is aſcribed to the grace of Chriſt. Gods predeſtination manifeſteth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XIX. Evidences of the ſame in the Old Teſtament; Of Gods help in getting the Land of Promiſe, and renewing the Covenant: And that for Chriſts ſake.

Whether man were at the firſt created to a ſupernaturall end, or not. An eſtate of meer nature, but innocent, poſſible. Originall ſinne is Concupiſcence. How Baptiſme voids it.

      * CHAP. XXI. The opinion that mak•s the Predetermination of mans will by God the ſourſe of his freedom; And wherein Janſenius differs from it. Of neceſsity upon ſuppoſition & abſolute. The neceſsity of the Will following the last dictate of the underſtanding is onely upon ſuppoſition, As alſo that which Gods foreſight creates. The difference between indifferent and undetermined.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Goſpel findeth man free from neceſſity, though not from bondage. Of the Antecedent and Conſequent Will of God. Praedetermination not the root, but the rooting up of Freedome and of Chriſtianity. Againſt the opinion of Janſenius.

      * CHAP. XXIII. A man is able to doe things truely honeſt under Originall ſin. But not to make God the end of all his doings. How all the actions of the Gentiles are ſins. They are accountable onely for the Law of nature. How all men have or have not Grace ſufficient to ſave.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Though God determineth not the will immediately, yet he determineth the effect thereof by the meanes of his providence, preſenting the object ſo as he foreſees it will chuſe, The caſes of Pharoah, of Solomon, of Ahab, and of the Jewes that crucified Chriſt. Of Gods foreknowledg of future conditionalls that come not to paſſe. The ground of foreknowledg of future contingencies. Difficult objections anſwered.

      * CHAP. XXV. The grounds of the difference between ſufficient and effectuall. How naturall occaſions, conduce to ſupernaturall actions, The inſufficience of Janſenius his doctrine. Of ſufficient grace under the Law of Moſes and Nature.

      * CHAP. XXVI. Predeſtination to grace abſolute, to glory reſpective: Purpoſe of denying effectuall Grace abſolute, of puniſhing reſpective. The end, to which God predeſtinates, is not the end for which he predeſtinates. Grace the reward of the right uſe of Grace. How much of the queſtion the Goſpell determines not. That our indeavours are ingaged no leſſe, then if predeſtination were not, it determineth. Of the Tradition of the Church; and of Semipelagians, Predeſtinatians and Arminians.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The queſtion concerning the ſatisfaction of Chriſt with Socinus. The reaſon why Sacrifices are figures of Chriſt, common to all ſacrifices. Why, and what Sacrifices the Fathers had, what the Law added. Of our ranſom by the price of Chriſts propitiatory Sacrifice.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Chriſt took away our ſinne by bearing the puniſhment of it. The Propheſie of Eſay LIII. We are reconciled to God by the Goſpel, in conſideration of Chriſts obedience. The reconcilement of Jews and Gentiles, Men and Angels, conſequent to the ſame. Of purging and expiating ſinne by Chriſt, and making propitiation for it. Of Chriſts dying for us.

      * CHAP. XXIX. The grant of Grace, in conſideration of Chriſt, ſuppoſes ſatisfaction made by him for ſinne. Neither our ſinnes imputable to Chriſt, nor his ſufferings to us, formally and perſonally, but, as the meritorious cauſes which ſatisfaction anſwereth. The effect of it, the Covenant of Grace, as well as help to performe it. The Fathers ſaved by the Faith of Chriſt to come. The Goſpel a new Law. The property of Satisfaction and Puniſhment in Chriſts ſufferings. Of the ſenſe of the Catholike Church.

      * CHAP. XXX. God might have reconciled man to himſelf without the coming of Chriſt. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend as well upon his active as paſſive obedience. Chriſt need not ſuffer •ell pa•nes that we might not. The opinion that maketh juſtifying Faith to be truſt in God not true; Yet not prejudiciall to the Faith. The decree of the Council of Trent, and the doctrine of the Schoole; how it is not prejudiciall to the Faith. As alſo that of Socinus.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ſtate of the queſtion concerning the perſeverance of thoſe that are once juſtified.

The recovery of Gods grace for a Chriſtian fallen from it, a work of labour and time. The neceſſity and efficacy of Penance to that purpoſe, according to the Scriptures, and the practiſe of the Church. Merit by virtue of Gods promiſe, neceſſary. The Catholicke Church agrees in it, the preſent Church of Rome allowes merit of juſtice▪

      * CHAP. I. The Society of the Church founded upon the duty of communicating in the Offices of Gods Service. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt, among thoſe Offices, proper to Chriſtianity. What opinions, concerning the preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood in the Euchariſt, are on foot.

      * CHAP. II. That the natural ſubſtance of the Elements remains in the Sacrament. That the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is nevertheleſſe preſent in the ſame, when it is received, not by the receiving of it. The eating of the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe neceſſarily requireth the ſame. This cauſes no contradiction nor improperty in the words of our Lord.

      * CHAP. III. That the preſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt depends not upon the living Faith of him that receives, but upon the true profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the Church that celebrates. The Scriptures that are alleged for the dependence of it upon the communication of the properties. They conclude not the ſenſe of them by whom they are alleged. How the Scripture confineth the fleſh of Chriſt to the Heavens.

      * CHAP. IV. The opinion which maketh the Conſecration to be done by rehearſing the operative words. That our Lord conſecrated by Thanksgiving. The Form of it in all Liturgies, together with the conſent of the Fathers. Evidence, that there is no Tradition of the Church for the aboliſhing of the Elements.

      * CHAP. V. It cannot be proved by the Old Teſtament that the Euchariſt is a Sacrifice. How, by the New Teſtament it may be ſo accounted. Four reaſons thereof, depending upon the nature of Juſtifying Faith premiſed. The conſent of the Catholick Church. The concurrence of the Church of England to the premiſes.

      * CHAP. VI. The reaſon of the Order by which I proceed, brings me to the Baptiſm of Infants in the next place. The power of the Keyes ſeen in granting Baptiſm, as well as in communicating the Euchariſt. Why Socinians make Baptiſm indifferent: Why Antinomians make it a miſtake to Baptize. The grounds upon which I ſhake off both: With anſwer to ſome objections.

      * CHAP. VII. The ground of baptizing Infants Originall ſinne, though not inſtituted till Chriſt roſe again. No other cure for it. Infants of Chriſtians may be Diſciples, are holy. The effect of Circumciſion under the Law, inferreth the effect of Baptiſm under the Goſpel.

      * CHAP. VIII. What is alleadged to impeach Tradition for baptizing Infants; Proves not, that any could be ſaved regularly, who dyed unbaptized; but, that, baptizing at yeares was a ſtrong means to make good Chriſtians. Why the Church now Baptize, Infants. What becomes of Infants dying unbaptized, unanſwerable. What thoſe Infants g•t who dye baptized.

      * CHAP. IX. What controverſie the Reformation hath with the Church of Rome about Penance. Inward repentance that is ſincere, obtaineth pardon alone. Remiſſion of ſinnes by the Goſpel onely: The condition of it by the Miniſtrey of the Church. What the power of binding and looſing contains more then Preaching, or taking away offenſes. Sinne may be pardoned without the uſe of it. Wherein the neceſſity of uſing it lyeth.

      * CHAP. X. The Sects of the Montaniſts, Novations, Donatiſts, and Meletians, evidence the cure of ſinne by Penance, to be a Tradition of the Apoſtles. So doth the agreement of primitive practice with their writings. Indulgence of regular Penance from the Apoſtles. Confeſſion of ſecret ſinnes in the Primitive Church. That no ſinne can be cured without the Keyes of the Church, there is no Tradition from the Apoſtles. The neceſſity of confeſſing ſecret ſinnes, whereupon it ſtands.

      * CHAP. IX. Penance is not required to redeem tho debt of temporall puniſhment when the ſinne is pardoned. What aſſurance of forgiveneſſe, the law of auricular Confeſſion, as it is uſed in the Church of Rome, procureth Of injoyning Penance, after abſolution performed. Setting aſide abuſes, the Law is agreeable to Gods. Of the order taken by the Church of England.

      * CHAP. XI. The Unction of the ſick pretendeth onely bodily health, upon ſuppoſition of the cure of ſinne by the Keyes of the Church. Objections anſwered. The Tradition of the Church evidenceth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XII. The ground of the Right of the Church in Matrimonial cauſes. Mariage of one with one inſolubly is a Law of Chriſtianity; The Law of Moſes not injoyning it. The Law of the Empire not aiming at the ground of it. Evidence from the primitive practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XIV. Scripture alleged to prove the bond of Mariage inſoluble in caſe of adultery, uneffectuall. S. Paul and our Lord ſpeak both to one purpoſe, according to S. Jerome, and S. Auſtine. The contrary opinion more reaſonable, and more general in the Church. Why the Church may reſtrain the innocent party from marying again. The Imperial Lawes could never be of force to void the Power of the Church. Evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIV. Another opinion, admitting the ground of lawfull Impediments. What Impediments ariſe upon the Conſtitution of the Church, generally as a Society, or particularly, as of Chriſtians.

Of Alexandria, Antiochia, Jeruſalem and Rome. Ground for the pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, before all Churches. The conſequence of that Ground. A ſummary of the evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIX. Of the proceedings about Marcion and Montanus at Rome. The buſineſse of Pope Victor about keeping Eaſter; a peremptory inſtance. The buſineſſe of the Novatians evidenceth the ſame. Of the buſineſſes concerning the rebaptizing of Hereticks, Dionyſius of Alexandria, Paulus Samoſatenus, S. Cypriane, and, of the Donatiſts under Conſtantine.

      * CHAP. XX. Of the conſtitution and authority of Councils. The ground of the pre-eminences of Churches in the Romane Empire. The VI. Canon of the Council of Nicaea.

      * CHAP. XXII. The people of God •ied to build Synagogues, though not by the leter of the Law. The Church to provide Churches, though the Scripture command it not. Preſcribing the form of Gods publick ſervice, is not quenching the Spirit. The Pſalter is preſcribed the Church for Gods Praiſes.

      * CHAP. XXIII. The conſideration of the Euchariſt preſcribed by Tradition, for the mater of it. Lords Prayer preſcribed in all ſervices. The mater of Prayers for all eſtates preſcribed. The form of Baptiſm neceſſary to be preſcribed. The ſame reaſon holdeth in the forms of other Offices.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Prayer the more principall Office of Gods ſervice then Preaching. Preachings, neither Gods word, nor the meanes of ſalvation, unleſſe limited to the Faith of Gods Church.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The Soules of the Fathers were not in the Devils Power till Chriſt; Though the Old Teſtament declare not their eſtate. Of Samuels ſoul. The ſoul of our Lord Chriſt, parting from his body, went with the Thiefe to Paradiſe. Of his triumph over the powers of darkneſſe. Prayer for the dead ſignifieth no delivering of ſoules out of Purgatory. The Covenant of Grace requires imperfect happineſſe before the generall judgement. Of forgiveneſſe in the world to come, and, paying the utmoſt farthing.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Ancient opinions in the Church, of the place of ſoules before the day of judgement. No Tradition that the Fathers were in the Ʋerge of Hell, under the Earth.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ground for a Monaſticall life in the Scriptures; And in the practice of the primitive Church. The Church getteth no peculiar intereſt in them who profeſſe it, by their profeſſing of it. The nature and intent of it renders it ſubordinate to the Clergy. How farre the ſingle life of the Clergy hath been a Law to the Church. Inexecution of the Canons for it. Nullity of the proceeddings of the Church of Rome in it. The intereſt of the People in the acts of the Church; And in the uſe of the Scriptures.

    _ The Third BOOK.

      * CHAP. I. All agree, that Reaſon is to decide controverſies of Faith. The objection, that Faith is taught by Gods Spirit, anſwered. What Reaſon decideth queſtions of Faith. The reſolution of Faith ends not in the light of Reaſon, but in that which Reaſon evidenceth to come from Gods meſſengers.

      * CHAP. II. The queſtion between the Scripture and the Church, which of them is Judge in matters of Faith. Whether opinion, the Tradition of the Church ſtands better with. Thoſe that hold the Scripture to be clear in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, have no reaſon to exclude the Tradition of the Church. What opinions they are, that deny the Church to be a Society or Corporation by Gods Law.

      * CHAP. III. That neither the ſentence of the Church, nor the dictate of Gods Spirit, can be the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be received. No man can know that hee hath Gods Spirit, without knowing that hee is a true Chriſtian; Which ſuppoſeth the truth of the Scripture. The motives of Faith are the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be believed: And the conſent of Gods people the reaſon that evidences thoſe motives to be infallibly true. How the Scriptures are believed for themſelves. How a Circle is made in rendering a reaſon of the Faith. The Scriptures are Gods Law to all, to whom they are publiſhed, by Gods act of publiſhing them; But Civil Law, by the act of Soveraign Powers, in acting Chriſtianity upon their Subjects.

      * CHAP. IV. Neither the Dictate of Gods Spirit nor the authority of the Church is the reaſon of believing any thing in Chriſtianity. Whether the Church be before the Scripture, or the Scripture before the Church. The Scriptures contain not the Infallibility of the Church. Nor the conſent of all Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. V. All things neceſſary to ſalvation are not clear in the Scriptures to all underſtandings. Not in the Old Teſtament. Not in the Goſpel. Not in the Writings of the Apoſtles. It is neceſſary to ſalvation to believe more than this, that our Lord is the Chriſt. Time cauſeth obſcurity in the Scriptures, aſwell as in other Records. That it is no where ſaid in the Scriptures, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are clear in the Scriptures. Neither is there any conſent of all Chriſtians to evidence the ſame.

      * CHAP. VI. All interpretation of Scripture is to be confined within the Tradition of the Church. This ſuppoſeth that the Church is a Communion inſtituted by God. What means there is to make evidence of Gods Charter, upon which the Corporation of the Church ſubſiſteth. The name of the Church, in the Scriptures, often ſignifieth the Whole or Cathelick Church.

      * CHAP. VII. That the Apoſtles delivered to the Church a Summary of Chriſtianity, which, all ſhould be baptized were to profeſs. Evidence out of the Scriptures. Evidence out of the Scriptures for Tradition regulating the Communion of the Church, and the Order of it. Evidence for the Rule of Faith, out of the records of the Church. For the Canons of the Church, and the pedegree of them from the Order eſtabliſhed in the Church by the Apoſtles. That the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and that by being baptized, is neceſſary to the ſalvation of a Chriſtian.

      * CHAP. VIII. That the Power of Governing the whole Church was in the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, and thoſe whom they took to aſſiſt them in the parts of it. The Power of their Succeſſors muſt needs be derived from thoſe. Why that Succeſſion which appeares in one Church, neceſſarily holdeth all Churches. The holding of Councils evidenceth the Ʋnity of the Church.

      * CHAP. IX. The Keyes of the Church given the Apoſtles, and exerciſed by Excommunication under the Apoſtles. The ground thereof is that profeſſion, which, all that are baptized are to make. That Penance and abatemeut of Penance hath been in force ever ſince and under the Apoſtles. In particular, of excluding Hereticks.

      * CHAP. X. Evidence of the Apoſtles act from the effect of it, in preſerving the Ʋnity of the Church. Of the buſineſſe of Marcion and Montanus. That about keeping Eaſter. That of the Novations, of rebaptizing Hereticks, of Paulus Samoſatenus, of Dionyſius Alexandrinus, and Arius. Of communicatory leters, and the intercourſe of the Church under and after the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. XI.Ʋpon what grounds the firſt book de Synedriis holds that the Church cannot excommunicate. Before the Law there was no ſuch Power, nor by it. Chriſtians went for Jewes under the Apoſtles. His ſenſe of ſome Scriptures. What the Leviatha• ſaith in general concerning the Power of the Church. Both ſuppoſe that Eccleſiaſtical Power includeth Temporal, which is not true. Of the Oxford Doctors Paraeneſis.

      * CHAP. XII. That the Law experſly covenanted for the Land of Promiſe. A great Objection againſt this, from the Great precept of the Law. The hope of the world to come under the Law, and the obedience which it requireth, was grounded upon reaſon from the true God, the Tradition of the Fathers, and the Doctrine of the Prophets. The Love of God above all by the Law extendeth no further than the precepts of the Law, the love of our Neighbor onely to Jewes. Of the Ceremonial, Judicial and Moral Law.

      * CHAP. XIII. That the Law tendreth no other promiſe but that of the Land of Canaan. How the Reſurrection is ſignified by the Prophets. Expreſſe texts of the Apoſtles. Their arguments, and the arguments of our Lord do ſuppoſe the myſtical ſenſe of the Scriptures. That this ſenſe is to be made good throughout the Scripture, whereſoever the ground of it takes place; Chriſtianity well grounded ſuppoſing this. What parts of Scripture may be queſtionable, whether they have a myſtical ſenſe or not. The ſayings and doings of our Lord have it; As alſo thoſe paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which are fulfilled by the ſame. The ſenſe of the Fathers.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Leviathans opin•on, that Chriſt came to reſtore that kingdome of God which the Jewes caſt off when they rejected Samuel. It overthroweth the foundation of Chriſtianity. The true Government of Gods ancient people. The name of the Church in the New Teſtament cannot ſignifie the Synagogue. Nor any Chriſtian State.

      * CHAP. XV. How the Power of the Church is founded upon the Law. The Power of the Kingdome, Prieſthood, Prophets, and Rulers of that people all of divine right. How farre theſe qualities and the powers of them are to continue in the Church. The ſenſe of the Fathers in this point. That the acts of S. Paul and the reſt of the Apoſtles were not of force by virtue of the Law. What Eccleſiaſtical Power ſhould have been among the Jewes, in caſe they had received the Goſpel, and ſo the State had ſtood.

      * CHAP. XVI. The Church founded upon the Power given the Apoſtles. What is the ſubject mater of Church Lawes. The right of the Church to Tithes and Oblations is not grounded upon the Law, though evidenced by it, and by practice of the Patriarchs. Evidence of the Apoſtles Order in the Scriptures. The Church of Jeruſalem held not community of Goods. The original practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power of Excommunication in the Church is not founded in the Law. What argument there is of it in the Old Teſtament. The allegorical ſenſe thereof is argumentative. It was not neceſſary that the Chriſtians ſhould incurre perſecution for uſing the Power of the Keyes, and not by virtue of the Law.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The difference between S. Pauls anathema and that of the Jewes. It is not neceſſary that the Chriſtians anathema ſhould ſignifie curſing. That the inceſtuous perſon at Corinth was Excommunicated by S. Paul. Juriſdiction of the Church. Telling the Church, binding and looſing, holding him that is bound for a Heathen or a Publicane, ſigniſie the ſame. The coherence of our Lords diſcourſe. Of Excommunication and Indulgence by private perſons in the Ancient Church. That Excommunication and the Power of the Church could not come in force by the voluntary conſent of the firſt Chriſtians. How it may be ſaid to be voluntary. Of the confederacy of the primitive Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XIX. That Power which was in Churches under the Apoſtles, can never be in any Chriſtian Soveraign. The difference between the Church and the Synagogue in that regard. The intereſt of Secular Power in determining maters of Faith preſuppoſeth the Society of the Church, and the act of it. No man can be bound to profeſſe the contrary of that which hee believeth. Every man is bound to profeſſe that Chriſtianity which hee believeth. The Church is the chief Teacher of Chriſtianity through Chriſtendom, as the Soveraign of Civil Peace, thorough his Dominions. Why the Church is to decide maters of Faith rather than the State, neither being infallible.

      * CHAP. XX. The reſt of the Oxford Doctors pretenſe. The Power of binding and looſing ſuppoſeth not onely the Preaching of the Goſpel, but the outward act of Faith. Chriſtians are not at liberty to caſt themſelves into what formes of Churches the Law of Nature alloweth. They are Judges in chief for themſelves in mater of Religion, ſuppoſing the Catholick Church; not otherwiſe. Secular Power cannot puniſh for Religion, but ſuppoſing the act of the Church, nor do any act to inforce Religion, unleſſe the Church determine the mater of it.

      * CHAP. XXI. How the Tradition of the Church limits the interpretation of Scriptures. How the declaration of the Church becomes a reaſonable mark of Hereſie. That which is not found in the Scriptures may have been delivered by the Apoſtles. Some things delivered by the Apoſtles, and recorded in the Scriptures; may not oblige. S. Auſtines Rule of Apoſtolical Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Authority of the Fathers is not grounded upon any preſumption of their Learning or Holineſſe. How farr they challenge the credit of Hiſtorical truth. The pre-eminenee of the Primitive. The preſumption that is grounded upon their ranks and qualities in the Church. Of Arnobius, Lactantius, Tertullian, Origen, Clemens, and the approbation of poſterity.

      * CHAP. XXIII. Two inſtances againſt the premiſes, beſides the objection concerning the beginning of Antichriſt under the Apoſtles. The general anſwer to it. The ſeven Trumpets in the Apocalypſe fore-tell the deſtruction of the Jewes. The ſeven Vials, the plagues inflicted upon the Empire for the ten perſecutions. The correſpondence of Deniels Propheſie inferreth the ſame. Neither S. Pauls Prophe••e nor S. Johns concerneth any Chriſtian. Neither the opinion of the Chiliaſts, nor the giving of the Euchariſt to Infants new Baptized, Catholick.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Two ſorts of means to reſolve whatſoever is reſolvable concerning the Scripture. Upon what terms the Church may, or is to determine controverſies of Faith. And what obligation that determination produceth. Traditions of the Apoſtles oblige the preſent Church, as the reaſons of them continue or not. Inſtances in our Lords Paſſeover and Euchariſt. Penance under the Apoſtles, and afterwards. S. Pauls vail, eating blood, and things offered to Idols. The power of the Church in limiting theſe Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXV. The power of the Church in limiting even the Traditions of the Apoſtles. Not every abuſe of this power, a ſufficient warrant for particular Churches to reforme themſelves. Hereſie conſiſts in denying ſomething, neceſſary to ſalvation to be believed. Schiſm, in departing from the unity of the Church, whether upon that, or any other cauſe. Implicite Faith no virtue; but the effect of it may be the work of Chriſtian charity.

      * CHAP. XXVI. What it is to adde to Gods Law; What to adde the Apocalypſe. S. Pauls Anathema. The Beraeans. S. Johns Goſpel ſufficient to make one believe; and the Scriptures, The man of God perfit. How the Law giveth light, and Chriſtians are taught by God. How Idolatry is ſaid, not to be commanded by God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. Why it was death to tranſgreſs the determinations of the Jews Conſiſtory, and what power this argueth in the Church. A difference between the authority of the Apoſtles, and that of the Church. The being of the Church to the worlds end, with power of the Keyes, makes it not infallible. Obedience to Superiors, and the Pillar of truth inferre it not.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The Fathers acknowledge the Sufficience and clearneſs of the Scriptures, as, the Traditions of the Church. They are to be reconciled, by limiting the terms which they uſe. The limitation of thoſe ſayings which make all Chriſtian truth to be contained in the Scriptures. Of thoſe which make the authority of the Church the ground of Faith.

      * CHAP. XXXII. Anſwer to an Objection, that choice of Religion becomes difficult upon theſe terms. This reſolution is for the Intereſt of the Reformation. Thoſe that make the Church Infallible cannot, thoſe that make the Scripture clear and ſufficient may own Tradition for evidence to determine the meaning of the Scriptures, and Controverſies of Faith. The Intereſt of the Church of England. The pretenſe of Ruſhworthes Dialogues, that wee have no unqueſtionable Scripture, and, that the Tradition of the Church never changes.

      * CHAP. XXXI. That the Scriptures which wee have are unqueſtionable. That miſtakes in Copying are not conſiderable to the ſenſe and effect of them. The meaning of the Hebrew and Greek, even of the Prophets, determinable, to the deciding of Controverſies. How Religion delivered by Tradition becomes ſubject to be corrupted.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. The Diſpute concerning the Canon of Scripture, and the tranſlations thereof, in two Queſtions. There can be no Tradition for thoſe books that were written ſince Propheſie ceaſed. Wherein the excellence of them above other books lies. The chief objections againſt them are queſtionable. In thoſe parcels of the New Teſtament that have been queſtioned, the caſe is not the ſame. The ſenſe of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Onely the Original Copy can be Authentick. But, the truth thereof may as well be found in the tranſlations of the Old Teſtament, as in the Jewes Copies. The Jewes have not falſified them of malice. The Points come neither from Moſes, nor Eſdras, but from the Talmud Jewes.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. Of the anci•n eſt Tranſlations of the Bible into Greek firſt; With the Authors and authority of the ſame; Then into the Chaldee, Syriack, and Latine. Exceptions againſt the Greek, and the Samaritane Pentateuch. They are helps nevertheleſs to aſſure the true reading of the Scriptures, though with other Copies; whether Jewiſh or Chriſtian. Though the Vulgar Latine were better than the preſent Greek, yet muſt both depend upon the Original Greek of the New Teſta•ent. No danger to Chriſtianity by the differences remaining in the Bible.

      * CHAP. 1. Two parts of that which remains. How the diſpute concerning the Holy Trinity with Socinus belongs to the firſt. The Queſtion of juſtification by Faith alone. The Opinion of Socinus concerning the whole Covenant of Grace. The opinion of thoſe who make juſtifying Faith the knowledge of a mans Predeſtination, oppoſite to it in the other extream. The difference between it and that of the Antinomians. That there are mean Opinions.

      * CHAP. II. Evidence what is the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. The contract of Baptiſm. The promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt annexed to Chriſts, not to Johns Baptiſm. Thoſe are made Chriſts Diſciples as Chriſtians that take up his Croſſe in Baptiſm. The effects of Baptiſm according to the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. III. The exhortations of the Apoſtles, that are drawn from the patterns of the Old Teſtament, ſuppoſe the ſame. How the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament are the ſame, how not the ſame. How the New Teſtament and the New Covenant are both one. The free-will of man acteth the ſame part in dealing about the New-Covenant, as about the Old. The Gospel a Law.

      * CHAP. IV. The conſent of the whole Church evidenced by the cuſtome of chatechiſing. By the opinion thereof concerning the ſalvation of thoſe that delayed their Baptiſm. By the rites and Ceremonies of Baptiſm. Why no penance for ſins before, but after Baptiſm. The doctrine of the Church of England evident in this caſe.

      * CHAP. V. The Preaching of our Lord and his Apoſtles evidenceth, that ſome act of Mans free choice is the condition which it requireth. The correspondence betwen the Old and New Teſtament inferreth the ſame. So do the errors of Socinians and Antinomians concerning the neceſſity of Baptiſm. Objections deferred.

      * CHAP. VI. Juſtifying Faith ſometimes conſiſts in believing the truth. Sometimes, in truſt in God grounded upon the truth. Somtimes in Chriſtianity, that is in imbracing and profeſſing it. And that in the Fathers as well as in the Scriptures. Of the informed and formed Faith of the Schools.

      * CHAP. VII. The laſt ſignification of Faith is properly justifying Faith. The firſt by a Metonymy of the cauſe: The ſecond of the effect. Thoſe that are not juſtified doe truly believe. The truſt of a Chriſtian preſuppoſeth him to be juſtified. All the promiſes of the Goſpel become due at once by the Covenant of Grace. That, to believe that we are Elect or Juſtified, is not Justifying Faith.

      * CHAP. VIII. The objection from S. Paul; We are not juſtified by the Law nor by Workes, but by Grace and by Faith. Not meant of the Goſpel, and the workes that ſuppoſe it. The queſtion that S. Paul ſpeakes to, is of the Law of Moſes and the Workes of it. He ſets thoſe workes in the ſame rank with the workes of the Gentils by the light of nature. The civil and outward workes of the Law may be done by Gentiles. How the Law is a Pedagogue to Chriſt.

      * CHAP. IX. Of the Faith and Juſtification of Abraham and the Patriarkes, according to the Apoſtles. Of the Prophets and righteous men under the Law. Abraham and Rahab the harlot juſtified by workes, if juſtified by Faith. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend upon works which the Goſpell injoyneth. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. X. What Pelagius queſtioneth concerning the Grace of Chriſt, what Socinus further of the ſtate of Chriſt before his birth. The oppoſition between the firſt and ſecond Adam in S. Paul, evidenceth originall ſinne. Coucupiſcence in the unregenerate, and the inability of the Law to ſubdue it, evict the ſame. The ſecond birth by the holy Ghoſt evidenceth that the first birth propagateth ſinne.

      * CHAP. X. The Old Teſtament chargeth all men as well as the wicked to be ſinfull from the wombe. David complaineth of himſelfe as born in ſinne, no leſſe then the Wiſe man of the children of the Gentiles. How Leviticall Lawes argue the ſame. And temporall death under the Old Teſtament. The book of Wiſdome and the Greek Bible.

      * CHAP. XII. The Haereſie of Simon Magus the beginning of the Gnoſticks. That they were in being during the Apoſtles time. Where and when the Haereſie of Cerinthus prevailed, and, that they were Gnoſticks. The beginning of the Encratites under the Apostles. It is evident that one God in Trinity was then glorified among the Christians, by the Fullneſſe of the Godhead which they introduced in ſtead of it.

      * CHAP. XIII. The Word was at the beginning of all things. The apparitions of the Old Teſtament Prefaces to the Incarnation of Chriſt. Ambaſſadors are not honoured with the honour due to their Maſters. The Word of God that was afterwards incarnate was in thoſe Angels that ſpoke in Gods Name. No Angel honoured as God under the New Teſtament. The Word was with God at the beginning of all things, as after his return.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Name of God not aſcribed to Chriſt for the like reaſon as to creatures. The reaſons why the Socinians worſhip Chriſt as God do confute their limitations. Chriſt not God by virtue of his riſing againe. He is the Great God with S. Paul, the true God, with S. John, the onely Lord, with S. Jude. Other Scriptures. Of the forme of God, and of a ſervant in S. Paul.

      * CHAP. XV. Not onely the Church but the World was made by Chriſt. The Word was made fleſh in oppoſition to the Spirit. How the Prophets, how Chriſtians, by receiving the Word of God, are poſſeſſed by his Spirit. How the title of Sonne of God importeth the Godhead. How Chriſt is the brightneſſe and Image of God.

      * CHAP. XVI. The teſtimonies of Chriſts Godhead in the Old Teſtament are firſt underſtood of the figures of Chriſt. Of the Wiſdome of God in Solomon and elſewhere. Of the writings of the Jewes as well before as after Chriſt.

      * CHAP. XVII. Anſwer to thoſe texts of Scripture that ſeem to abate the true Godhead in Chriſt. Of that creature whereof Chriſt is the firſt-borne, and that which the Wiſdome of God made. That this beliefe is the originall Tradition of the Church. What meanes this diſpute furniſheth us with againſt the Arrians. That it is reaſon to ſubmit to revelation concerning the nature of God. The uſe of reaſon is no way renounced by holding this Faith.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The neceſſity of the grace of Chriſt, is the evidence of originall ſinne. How the exaltation of our Lord depends upon his humiliation, and the grace of Christ upon that▪ All the work of Chriſtianity is aſcribed to the grace of Chriſt. Gods predeſtination manifeſteth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XIX. Evidences of the ſame in the Old Teſtament; Of Gods help in getting the Land of Promiſe, and renewing the Covenant: And that for Chriſts ſake. That Chriſtianity cannot ſtand without acknowledging the grace of Chriſt. The Tradition of the Church; In the Baptiſme of Infants: In the Prayers of the Church; In the decrees against Pelagius and other records of the Church.

      * CHAP. XX. Wherein Originall ſinne conſiſteth; What opinions are on foot. That it is not Adams ſinne imputed to his poſterity. Whether man were at the firſt created to a ſupernaturall end, or not. An eſtate of meer nature, but innocent, poſſible. Originall ſinne is Concupiſcence. How Baptiſme voids it. Concerning the late novelty in the Church of England about Originall ſinne.

      * CHAP. XXI. The opinion that mak•s the Predetermination of mans will by God the ſourſe of his freedom; And wherein Janſenius differs from it. Of neceſsity upon ſuppoſition & abſolute. The neceſsity of the Will following the last dictate of the underſtanding is onely upon ſuppoſition, As alſo that which Gods foreſight creates. The difference between indifferent and undetermined.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Goſpel findeth man free from neceſſity, though not from bondage. Of the Antecedent and Conſequent Will of God. Praedetermination not the root, but the rooting up of Freedome and of Chriſtianity. Againſt the opinion of Janſenius.

      * CHAP. XXIII. A man is able to doe things truely honeſt under Originall ſin. But not to make God the end of all his doings. How all the actions of the Gentiles are ſins. They are accountable onely for the Law of nature. How all men have or have not Grace ſufficient to ſave.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Though God determineth not the will immediately, yet he determineth the effect thereof by the meanes of his providence, preſenting the object ſo as he foreſees it will chuſe, The caſes of Pharoah, of Solomon, of Ahab, and of the Jewes that crucified Chriſt. Of Gods foreknowledg of future conditionalls that come not to paſſe. The ground of foreknowledg of future contingencies. Difficult objections anſwered.

      * CHAP. XXV. The grounds of the difference between ſufficient and effectuall. How naturall occaſions, conduce to ſupernaturall actions, The inſufficience of Janſenius his doctrine. Of ſufficient grace under the Law of Moſes and Nature.

      * CHAP. XXVI. Predeſtination to grace abſolute, to glory reſpective: Purpoſe of denying effectuall Grace abſolute, of puniſhing reſpective. The end, to which God predeſtinates, is not the end for which he predeſtinates. Grace the reward of the right uſe of Grace. How much of the queſtion the Goſpell determines not. That our indeavours are ingaged no leſſe, then if predeſtination were not, it determineth. Of the Tradition of the Church; and of Semipelagians, Predeſtinatians and Arminians.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The queſtion concerning the ſatisfaction of Chriſt with Socinus. The reaſon why Sacrifices are figures of Chriſt, common to all ſacrifices. Why, and what Sacrifices the Fathers had, what the Law added. Of our ranſom by the price of Chriſts propitiatory Sacrifice.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Chriſt took away our ſinne by bearing the puniſhment of it. The Propheſie of Eſay LIII. We are reconciled to God by the Goſpel, in conſideration of Chriſts obedience. The reconcilement of Jews and Gentiles, Men and Angels, conſequent to the ſame. Of purging and expiating ſinne by Chriſt, and making propitiation for it. Of Chriſts dying for us.

      * CHAP. XXIX. The grant of Grace, in conſideration of Chriſt, ſuppoſes ſatisfaction made by him for ſinne. Neither our ſinnes imputable to Chriſt, nor his ſufferings to us, formally and perſonally, but, as the meritorious cauſes which ſatisfaction anſwereth. The effect of it, the Covenant of Grace, as well as help to performe it. The Fathers ſaved by the Faith of Chriſt to come. The Goſpel a new Law. The property of Satisfaction and Puniſhment in Chriſts ſufferings. Of the ſenſe of the Catholike Church.

      * CHAP. XXX. God might have reconciled man to himſelf without the coming of Chriſt. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend as well upon his active as paſſive obedience. Chriſt need not ſuffer •ell pa•nes that we might not. The opinion that maketh juſtifying Faith to be truſt in God not true; Yet not prejudiciall to the Faith. The decree of the Council of Trent, and the doctrine of the Schoole; how it is not prejudiciall to the Faith. As alſo that of Socinus.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ſtate of the queſtion concerning the perſeverance of thoſe that are once juſtified. Of three ſenſes, one true, one inconſiſtent with the Faith, the third neither true nor yet deſtructive to the Faith. Evidence from the writings of the Apoſtles. From the Old Teſtament. The grace of Propheſie when it preſuppoſeth ſanctifying grace. Anſwer to ſome Texts, and of S. Pauls meaning in the VII. of the Romans. Of the Polygamy of the Fathers. What aſſurance of Grace Chriſtians may have. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How the fullfilling of Gods Law is poſſible, how impoſſible▪ for a Chriſtian. Of the difference between mortall and v•niall ſinne. What love of God and of our neighbour was neceſſary under the Old Teſtament. Whether the S•rmon in the Mount correct the falſe interpretation of the Jewes, or inhanſe the obligation of the Law. Of the difference between matter of Precept and matter of Counſail; and the Perfection of Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Whether any workes of Chriſtians be ſatisfactory for ſinne, and meritorious of heaven, or not. The recovery of Gods grace for a Chriſtian fallen from it, a work of labour and time. The neceſſity and efficacy of Penance to that purpoſe, according to the Scriptures, and the practiſe of the Church. Merit by virtue of Gods promiſe, neceſſary. The Catholicke Church agrees in it, the preſent Church of Rome allowes merit of juſtice▪

      * CHAP. I. The Society of the Church founded upon the duty of communicating in the Offices of Gods Service. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt, among thoſe Offices, proper to Chriſtianity. What opinions, concerning the preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood in the Euchariſt, are on foot.

      * CHAP. II. That the natural ſubſtance of the Elements remains in the Sacrament. That the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is nevertheleſſe preſent in the ſame, when it is received, not by the receiving of it. The eating of the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe neceſſarily requireth the ſame. This cauſes no contradiction nor improperty in the words of our Lord.

      * CHAP. III. That the preſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt depends not upon the living Faith of him that receives, but upon the true profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the Church that celebrates. The Scriptures that are alleged for the dependence of it upon the communication of the properties. They conclude not the ſenſe of them by whom they are alleged. How the Scripture confineth the fleſh of Chriſt to the Heavens.

      * CHAP. IV. The opinion which maketh the Conſecration to be done by rehearſing the operative words. That our Lord conſecrated by Thanksgiving. The Form of it in all Liturgies, together with the conſent of the Fathers. Evidence, that there is no Tradition of the Church for the aboliſhing of the Elements.

      * CHAP. V. It cannot be proved by the Old Teſtament that the Euchariſt is a Sacrifice. How, by the New Teſtament it may be ſo accounted. Four reaſons thereof, depending upon the nature of Juſtifying Faith premiſed. The conſent of the Catholick Church. The concurrence of the Church of England to the premiſes.

      * CHAP. VI. The reaſon of the Order by which I proceed, brings me to the Baptiſm of Infants in the next place. The power of the Keyes ſeen in granting Baptiſm, as well as in communicating the Euchariſt. Why Socinians make Baptiſm indifferent: Why Antinomians make it a miſtake to Baptize. The grounds upon which I ſhake off both: With anſwer to ſome objections.

      * CHAP. VII. The ground of baptizing Infants Originall ſinne, though not inſtituted till Chriſt roſe again. No other cure for it. Infants of Chriſtians may be Diſciples, are holy. The effect of Circumciſion under the Law, inferreth the effect of Baptiſm under the Goſpel.

      * CHAP. VIII. What is alleadged to impeach Tradition for baptizing Infants; Proves not, that any could be ſaved regularly, who dyed unbaptized; but, that, baptizing at yeares was a ſtrong means to make good Chriſtians. Why the Church now Baptize, Infants. What becomes of Infants dying unbaptized, unanſwerable. What thoſe Infants g•t who dye baptized.

      * CHAP. IX. What controverſie the Reformation hath with the Church of Rome about Penance. Inward repentance that is ſincere, obtaineth pardon alone. Remiſſion of ſinnes by the Goſpel onely: The condition of it by the Miniſtrey of the Church. What the power of binding and looſing contains more then Preaching, or taking away offenſes. Sinne may be pardoned without the uſe of it. Wherein the neceſſity of uſing it lyeth.

      * CHAP. X. The Sects of the Montaniſts, Novations, Donatiſts, and Meletians, evidence the cure of ſinne by Penance, to be a Tradition of the Apoſtles. So doth the agreement of primitive practice with their writings. Indulgence of regular Penance from the Apoſtles. Confeſſion of ſecret ſinnes in the Primitive Church. That no ſinne can be cured without the Keyes of the Church, there is no Tradition from the Apoſtles. The neceſſity of confeſſing ſecret ſinnes, whereupon it ſtands.

      * CHAP. IX. Penance is not required to redeem tho debt of temporall puniſhment when the ſinne is pardoned. What aſſurance of forgiveneſſe, the law of auricular Confeſſion, as it is uſed in the Church of Rome, procureth Of injoyning Penance, after abſolution performed. Setting aſide abuſes, the Law is agreeable to Gods. Of the order taken by the Church of England.

      * CHAP. XI. The Unction of the ſick pretendeth onely bodily health, upon ſuppoſition of the cure of ſinne by the Keyes of the Church. Objections anſwered. The Tradition of the Church evidenceth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XII. The ground of the Right of the Church in Matrimonial cauſes. Mariage of one with one inſolubly is a Law of Chriſtianity; The Law of Moſes not injoyning it. The Law of the Empire not aiming at the ground of it. Evidence from the primitive practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XIV. Scripture alleged to prove the bond of Mariage inſoluble in caſe of adultery, uneffectuall. S. Paul and our Lord ſpeak both to one purpoſe, according to S. Jerome, and S. Auſtine. The contrary opinion more reaſonable, and more general in the Church. Why the Church may reſtrain the innocent party from marying again. The Imperial Lawes could never be of force to void the Power of the Church. Evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIV. Another opinion, admitting the ground of lawfull Impediments. What Impediments ariſe upon the Conſtitution of the Church, generally as a Society, or particularly, as of Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XVI. Of the Power of making Gouernours and Miniſters of the Church. Upon what ground the Hierarchy of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons ſtandeth, in oppoſition to Presbyteries and Congregations. Of the Power of Confirming, and the evidence of the Hierarchy which it yieldeth. Of thoſe Scriptures which ſeem to ſpeak of Presbyteries or Congregations.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power given the XII. under the Title of Apoſtles, and the LXX. Diſciples. That the VII were Deacons. Of the firſt Presbyters at Jeruſalem, and the Intereſt of the People. Presbyters appropriated to Churches, under the Apoſtles. S. Pauls Deacons no Presbyters. No ground for Lay Flders.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The Apoſtles all of oequall power; S. Peter onely chiefe in managing it. The ground for the pre-•minence of Churches, before and over Churches. Of Alexandria, Antiochia, Jeruſalem and Rome. Ground for the pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, before all Churches. The conſequence of that Ground. A ſummary of the evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XX. Of the conſtitution and authority of Councils. The ground of the pre-eminences of Churches in the Romane Empire. The VI. Canon of the Council of Nicaea. The pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, and that of Conſtantinople. Some inſtances againſt the ſuperiority of Biſhops, out of the records of the Church; what offices every Order by Gods Law, or by Canon Law, miniſtreth.

      * CHAP. XXI. Of the times of God ſervice; By what Title of his Law the firſt day of the week is kept Holy. How the Sabbath is to be ſanctified by Moſes Law.

Of the difference of meats, and meaſure of Faſting. Of the keeping o four Lords Birthday, and other Feſtivals, and the regular hours of the day for Gods ſervice.

      * CHAP. XXII. The people of God •ied to build Synagogues, though not by the leter of the Law. The Church to provide Churches, though the Scripture command it not. Preſcribing the form of Gods publick ſervice, is not quenching the Spirit. The Pſalter is preſcribed the Church for Gods Praiſes. The Scriptures preſcribed to be read in the Church; The Order of reading them to be preſcribed by the Church.

      * CHAP. XXIII. The conſideration of the Euchariſt preſcribed by Tradition, for the mater of it. Lords Prayer preſcribed in all ſervices. The mater of Prayers for all eſtates preſcribed. The form of Baptiſm neceſſary to be preſcribed. The ſame reaſon holdeth in the forms of other Offices.

      * CHAP. XXX. To worſhip Chriſt in the Euchariſt, though believing tranſubstantiation, is not Idolatry. Ground for the honour of Saints and Martyrs. The Saints and the Angels pray for us. Three ſorts of prayers to Saints: The firſt, agreeable with Chriſtianity: The laſt may be Idolatry: The ſecond a ſtep to it. Of the Reliques of the Saints Bodies. What the ſecond Commandement prohibiteth or alloweth. The ſecond Councile of Nicea doth not decree Idolatry; And yet there is no decree in the Church for the worſhiping of Images.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ground for a Monaſticall life in the Scriptures; And in the practice of the primitive Church. The Church getteth no peculiar intereſt in them who profeſſe it, by their profeſſing of it. The nature and intent of it renders it ſubordinate to the Clergy. How farre the ſingle life of the Clergy hath been a Law to the Church. Inexecution of the Canons for it. Nullity of the proceeddings of the Church of Rome in it. The intereſt of the People in the acts of the Church; And in the uſe of the Scriptures.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How great the Power of the Church, and the effect of it is. The right of judging the cauſes of Chriſtians c•aſeth, when it is protected by the State. An Objection; If Eccl•ſiaſticall Power were from God, Secular Power could not limit the uſe of it. Ground for the Intereſt of the State in Church matters. The inconſequence of the argument. The concurrence of both Intereſts to the Law of the Church. The Intereſt of the State in the indowment of the Church. Concurrence of both in matrimoniall cauſes, and Ordinations. Temporall penalties upon Excommunication from the State. No Soveraigne ſubject to the greater Excommunication, but to the leſſe. The Rights of the Jewes State and of Chriſtian Powers, in Religion, partly the ſame, partly not. The infinite Power of the Pope not founded upon acts of Epiſcopacy, but upon the Secular Powers of Chriſtendome.

1. A CONCLUSION To all CHRISTIAN READERS.

    _ The Firſt BOOK.

      * CHAP. I. All agree, that Reaſon is to decide controverſies of Faith. The objection, that Faith is taught by Gods Spirit, anſwered. What Reaſon decideth queſtions of Faith. The reſolution of Faith ends not in the light of Reaſon, but in that which Reaſon evidenceth to come from Gods meſſengers.

      * CHAP. II. The queſtion between the Scripture and the Church, which of them is Judge in matters of Faith. Whether opinion, the Tradition of the Church ſtands better with. Thoſe that hold the Scripture to be clear in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, have no reaſon to exclude the Tradition of the Church. What opinions they are, that deny the Church to be a Society or Corporation by Gods Law.

      * CHAP. III. That neither the ſentence of the Church, nor the dictate of Gods Spirit, can be the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be received. No man can know that hee hath Gods Spirit, without knowing that hee is a true Chriſtian; Which ſuppoſeth the truth of the Scripture. The motives of Faith are the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be believed: And the conſent of Gods people the reaſon that evidences thoſe motives to be infallibly true. How the Scriptures are believed for themſelves. How a Circle is made in rendering a reaſon of the Faith. The Scriptures are Gods Law to all, to whom they are publiſhed, by Gods act of publiſhing them; But Civil Law, by the act of Soveraign Powers, in acting Chriſtianity upon their Subjects.

      * CHAP. IV. Neither the Dictate of Gods Spirit nor the authority of the Church is the reaſon of believing any thing in Chriſtianity. Whether the Church be before the Scripture, or the Scripture before the Church. The Scriptures contain not the Infallibility of the Church. Nor the conſent of all Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. V. All things neceſſary to ſalvation are not clear in the Scriptures to all underſtandings. Not in the Old Teſtament. Not in the Goſpel. Not in the Writings of the Apoſtles. It is neceſſary to ſalvation to believe more than this, that our Lord is the Chriſt. Time cauſeth obſcurity in the Scriptures, aſwell as in other Records. That it is no where ſaid in the Scriptures, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are clear in the Scriptures. Neither is there any conſent of all Chriſtians to evidence the ſame.

      * CHAP. VI. All interpretation of Scripture is to be confined within the Tradition of the Church. This ſuppoſeth that the Church is a Communion inſtituted by God. What means there is to make evidence of Gods Charter, upon which the Corporation of the Church ſubſiſteth. The name of the Church, in the Scriptures, often ſignifieth the Whole or Cathelick Church.

      * CHAP. VII. That the Apoſtles delivered to the Church a Summary of Chriſtianity, which, all ſhould be baptized were to profeſs. Evidence out of the Scriptures. Evidence out of the Scriptures for Tradition regulating the Communion of the Church, and the Order of it. Evidence for the Rule of Faith, out of the records of the Church. For the Canons of the Church, and the pedegree of them from the Order eſtabliſhed in the Church by the Apoſtles. That the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and that by being baptized, is neceſſary to the ſalvation of a Chriſtian.

      * CHAP. VIII. That the Power of Governing the whole Church was in the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, and thoſe whom they took to aſſiſt them in the parts of it. The Power of their Succeſſors muſt needs be derived from thoſe. Why that Succeſſion which appeares in one Church, neceſſarily holdeth all Churches. The holding of Councils evidenceth the Ʋnity of the Church.

      * CHAP. IX. The Keyes of the Church given the Apoſtles, and exerciſed by Excommunication under the Apoſtles. The ground thereof is that profeſſion, which, all that are baptized are to make. That Penance and abatemeut of Penance hath been in force ever ſince and under the Apoſtles. In particular, of excluding Hereticks.

      * CHAP. X. Evidence of the Apoſtles act from the effect of it, in preſerving the Ʋnity of the Church. Of the buſineſſe of Marcion and Montanus. That about keeping Eaſter. That of the Novations, of rebaptizing Hereticks, of Paulus Samoſatenus, of Dionyſius Alexandrinus, and Arius. Of communicatory leters, and the intercourſe of the Church under and after the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. XI.Ʋpon what grounds the firſt book de Synedriis holds that the Church cannot excommunicate. Before the Law there was no ſuch Power, nor by it. Chriſtians went for Jewes under the Apoſtles. His ſenſe of ſome Scriptures. What the Leviatha• ſaith in general concerning the Power of the Church. Both ſuppoſe that Eccleſiaſtical Power includeth Temporal, which is not true. Of the Oxford Doctors Paraeneſis.

      * CHAP. XII. That the Law experſly covenanted for the Land of Promiſe. A great Objection againſt this, from the Great precept of the Law. The hope of the world to come under the Law, and the obedience which it requireth, was grounded upon reaſon from the true God, the Tradition of the Fathers, and the Doctrine of the Prophets. The Love of God above all by the Law extendeth no further than the precepts of the Law, the love of our Neighbor onely to Jewes. Of the Ceremonial, Judicial and Moral Law.

      * CHAP. XIII. That the Law tendreth no other promiſe but that of the Land of Canaan. How the Reſurrection is ſignified by the Prophets. Expreſſe texts of the Apoſtles. Their arguments, and the arguments of our Lord do ſuppoſe the myſtical ſenſe of the Scriptures. That this ſenſe is to be made good throughout the Scripture, whereſoever the ground of it takes place; Chriſtianity well grounded ſuppoſing this. What parts of Scripture may be queſtionable, whether they have a myſtical ſenſe or not. The ſayings and doings of our Lord have it; As alſo thoſe paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which are fulfilled by the ſame. The ſenſe of the Fathers.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Leviathans opin•on, that Chriſt came to reſtore that kingdome of God which the Jewes caſt off when they rejected Samuel. It overthroweth the foundation of Chriſtianity. The true Government of Gods ancient people. The name of the Church in the New Teſtament cannot ſignifie the Synagogue. Nor any Chriſtian State.

      * CHAP. XV. How the Power of the Church is founded upon the Law. The Power of the Kingdome, Prieſthood, Prophets, and Rulers of that people all of divine right. How farre theſe qualities and the powers of them are to continue in the Church. The ſenſe of the Fathers in this point. That the acts of S. Paul and the reſt of the Apoſtles were not of force by virtue of the Law. What Eccleſiaſtical Power ſhould have been among the Jewes, in caſe they had received the Goſpel, and ſo the State had ſtood.

      * CHAP. XVI. The Church founded upon the Power given the Apoſtles. What is the ſubject mater of Church Lawes. The right of the Church to Tithes and Oblations is not grounded upon the Law, though evidenced by it, and by practice of the Patriarchs. Evidence of the Apoſtles Order in the Scriptures. The Church of Jeruſalem held not community of Goods. The original practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power of Excommunication in the Church is not founded in the Law. What argument there is of it in the Old Teſtament. The allegorical ſenſe thereof is argumentative. It was not neceſſary that the Chriſtians ſhould incurre perſecution for uſing the Power of the Keyes, and not by virtue of the Law.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The difference between S. Pauls anathema and that of the Jewes. It is not neceſſary that the Chriſtians anathema ſhould ſignifie curſing. That the inceſtuous perſon at Corinth was Excommunicated by S. Paul. Juriſdiction of the Church. Telling the Church, binding and looſing, holding him that is bound for a Heathen or a Publicane, ſigniſie the ſame. The coherence of our Lords diſcourſe. Of Excommunication and Indulgence by private perſons in the Ancient Church. That Excommunication and the Power of the Church could not come in force by the voluntary conſent of the firſt Chriſtians. How it may be ſaid to be voluntary. Of the confederacy of the primitive Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XIX. That Power which was in Churches under the Apoſtles, can never be in any Chriſtian Soveraign. The difference between the Church and the Synagogue in that regard. The intereſt of Secular Power in determining maters of Faith preſuppoſeth the Society of the Church, and the act of it. No man can be bound to profeſſe the contrary of that which hee believeth. Every man is bound to profeſſe that Chriſtianity which hee believeth. The Church is the chief Teacher of Chriſtianity through Chriſtendom, as the Soveraign of Civil Peace, thorough his Dominions. Why the Church is to decide maters of Faith rather than the State, neither being infallible.

      * CHAP. XX. The reſt of the Oxford Doctors pretenſe. The Power of binding and looſing ſuppoſeth not onely the Preaching of the Goſpel, but the outward act of Faith. Chriſtians are not at liberty to caſt themſelves into what formes of Churches the Law of Nature alloweth. They are Judges in chief for themſelves in mater of Religion, ſuppoſing the Catholick Church; not otherwiſe. Secular Power cannot puniſh for Religion, but ſuppoſing the act of the Church, nor do any act to inforce Religion, unleſſe the Church determine the mater of it.

      * CHAP. XXI. How the Tradition of the Church limits the interpretation of Scriptures. How the declaration of the Church becomes a reaſonable mark of Hereſie. That which is not found in the Scriptures may have been delivered by the Apoſtles. Some things delivered by the Apoſtles, and recorded in the Scriptures; may not oblige. S. Auſtines Rule of Apoſtolical Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Authority of the Fathers is not grounded upon any preſumption of their Learning or Holineſſe. How farr they challenge the credit of Hiſtorical truth. The pre-eminenee of the Primitive. The preſumption that is grounded upon their ranks and qualities in the Church. Of Arnobius, Lactantius, Tertullian, Origen, Clemens, and the approbation of poſterity.

      * CHAP. XXIII. Two inſtances againſt the premiſes, beſides the objection concerning the beginning of Antichriſt under the Apoſtles. The general anſwer to it. The ſeven Trumpets in the Apocalypſe fore-tell the deſtruction of the Jewes. The ſeven Vials, the plagues inflicted upon the Empire for the ten perſecutions. The correſpondence of Deniels Propheſie inferreth the ſame. Neither S. Pauls Prophe••e nor S. Johns concerneth any Chriſtian. Neither the opinion of the Chiliaſts, nor the giving of the Euchariſt to Infants new Baptized, Catholick.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Two ſorts of means to reſolve whatſoever is reſolvable concerning the Scripture. Upon what terms the Church may, or is to determine controverſies of Faith. And what obligation that determination produceth. Traditions of the Apoſtles oblige the preſent Church, as the reaſons of them continue or not. Inſtances in our Lords Paſſeover and Euchariſt. Penance under the Apoſtles, and afterwards. S. Pauls vail, eating blood, and things offered to Idols. The power of the Church in limiting theſe Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXV. The power of the Church in limiting even the Traditions of the Apoſtles. Not every abuſe of this power, a ſufficient warrant for particular Churches to reforme themſelves. Hereſie conſiſts in denying ſomething, neceſſary to ſalvation to be believed. Schiſm, in departing from the unity of the Church, whether upon that, or any other cauſe. Implicite Faith no virtue; but the effect of it may be the work of Chriſtian charity.

      * CHAP. XXVI. What it is to adde to Gods Law; What to adde the Apocalypſe. S. Pauls Anathema. The Beraeans. S. Johns Goſpel ſufficient to make one believe; and the Scriptures, The man of God perfit. How the Law giveth light, and Chriſtians are taught by God. How Idolatry is ſaid, not to be commanded by God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. Why it was death to tranſgreſs the determinations of the Jews Conſiſtory, and what power this argueth in the Church. A difference between the authority of the Apoſtles, and that of the Church. The being of the Church to the worlds end, with power of the Keyes, makes it not infallible. Obedience to Superiors, and the Pillar of truth inferre it not.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The Fathers acknowledge the Sufficience and clearneſs of the Scriptures, as, the Traditions of the Church. They are to be reconciled, by limiting the terms which they uſe. The limitation of thoſe ſayings which make all Chriſtian truth to be contained in the Scriptures. Of thoſe which make the authority of the Church the ground of Faith.

      * CHAP. XXXII. Anſwer to an Objection, that choice of Religion becomes difficult upon theſe terms. This reſolution is for the Intereſt of the Reformation. Thoſe that make the Church Infallible cannot, thoſe that make the Scripture clear and ſufficient may own Tradition for evidence to determine the meaning of the Scriptures, and Controverſies of Faith. The Intereſt of the Church of England. The pretenſe of Ruſhworthes Dialogues, that wee have no unqueſtionable Scripture, and, that the Tradition of the Church never changes.

      * CHAP. XXXI. That the Scriptures which wee have are unqueſtionable. That miſtakes in Copying are not conſiderable to the ſenſe and effect of them. The meaning of the Hebrew and Greek, even of the Prophets, determinable, to the deciding of Controverſies. How Religion delivered by Tradition becomes ſubject to be corrupted.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. The Diſpute concerning the Canon of Scripture, and the tranſlations thereof, in two Queſtions. There can be no Tradition for thoſe books that were written ſince Propheſie ceaſed. Wherein the excellence of them above other books lies. The chief objections againſt them are queſtionable. In thoſe parcels of the New Teſtament that have been queſtioned, the caſe is not the ſame. The ſenſe of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Onely the Original Copy can be Authentick. But, the truth thereof may as well be found in the tranſlations of the Old Teſtament, as in the Jewes Copies. The Jewes have not falſified them of malice. The Points come neither from Moſes, nor Eſdras, but from the Talmud Jewes.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. Of the anci•n eſt Tranſlations of the Bible into Greek firſt; With the Authors and authority of the ſame; Then into the Chaldee, Syriack, and Latine. Exceptions againſt the Greek, and the Samaritane Pentateuch. They are helps nevertheleſs to aſſure the true reading of the Scriptures, though with other Copies; whether Jewiſh or Chriſtian. Though the Vulgar Latine were better than the preſent Greek, yet muſt both depend upon the Original Greek of the New Teſta•ent. No danger to Chriſtianity by the differences remaining in the Bible.

      * CHAP. 1. Two parts of that which remains. How the diſpute concerning the Holy Trinity with Socinus belongs to the firſt. The Queſtion of juſtification by Faith alone. The Opinion of Socinus concerning the whole Covenant of Grace. The opinion of thoſe who make juſtifying Faith the knowledge of a mans Predeſtination, oppoſite to it in the other extream. The difference between it and that of the Antinomians. That there are mean Opinions.

      * CHAP. II. Evidence what is the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. The contract of Baptiſm. The promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt annexed to Chriſts, not to Johns Baptiſm. Thoſe are made Chriſts Diſciples as Chriſtians that take up his Croſſe in Baptiſm. The effects of Baptiſm according to the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. III. The exhortations of the Apoſtles, that are drawn from the patterns of the Old Teſtament, ſuppoſe the ſame. How the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament are the ſame, how not the ſame. How the New Teſtament and the New Covenant are both one. The free-will of man acteth the ſame part in dealing about the New-Covenant, as about the Old. The Gospel a Law.

      * CHAP. IV. The conſent of the whole Church evidenced by the cuſtome of chatechiſing. By the opinion thereof concerning the ſalvation of thoſe that delayed their Baptiſm. By the rites and Ceremonies of Baptiſm. Why no penance for ſins before, but after Baptiſm. The doctrine of the Church of England evident in this caſe.

      * CHAP. V. The Preaching of our Lord and his Apoſtles evidenceth, that ſome act of Mans free choice is the condition which it requireth. The correspondence betwen the Old and New Teſtament inferreth the ſame. So do the errors of Socinians and Antinomians concerning the neceſſity of Baptiſm. Objections deferred.

      * CHAP. VI. Juſtifying Faith ſometimes conſiſts in believing the truth. Sometimes, in truſt in God grounded upon the truth. Somtimes in Chriſtianity, that is in imbracing and profeſſing it. And that in the Fathers as well as in the Scriptures. Of the informed and formed Faith of the Schools.

      * CHAP. VII. The laſt ſignification of Faith is properly justifying Faith. The firſt by a Metonymy of the cauſe: The ſecond of the effect. Thoſe that are not juſtified doe truly believe. The truſt of a Chriſtian preſuppoſeth him to be juſtified. All the promiſes of the Goſpel become due at once by the Covenant of Grace. That, to believe that we are Elect or Juſtified, is not Justifying Faith.

      * CHAP. VIII. The objection from S. Paul; We are not juſtified by the Law nor by Workes, but by Grace and by Faith. Not meant of the Goſpel, and the workes that ſuppoſe it. The queſtion that S. Paul ſpeakes to, is of the Law of Moſes and the Workes of it. He ſets thoſe workes in the ſame rank with the workes of the Gentils by the light of nature. The civil and outward workes of the Law may be done by Gentiles. How the Law is a Pedagogue to Chriſt.

      * CHAP. IX. Of the Faith and Juſtification of Abraham and the Patriarkes, according to the Apoſtles. Of the Prophets and righteous men under the Law. Abraham and Rahab the harlot juſtified by workes, if juſtified by Faith. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend upon works which the Goſpell injoyneth. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. X. What Pelagius queſtioneth concerning the Grace of Chriſt, what Socinus further of the ſtate of Chriſt before his birth. The oppoſition between the firſt and ſecond Adam in S. Paul, evidenceth originall ſinne. Coucupiſcence in the unregenerate, and the inability of the Law to ſubdue it, evict the ſame. The ſecond birth by the holy Ghoſt evidenceth that the first birth propagateth ſinne.

      * CHAP. X. The Old Teſtament chargeth all men as well as the wicked to be ſinfull from the wombe. David complaineth of himſelfe as born in ſinne, no leſſe then the Wiſe man of the children of the Gentiles. How Leviticall Lawes argue the ſame. And temporall death under the Old Teſtament. The book of Wiſdome and the Greek Bible.

      * CHAP. XII. The Haereſie of Simon Magus the beginning of the Gnoſticks. That they were in being during the Apoſtles time. Where and when the Haereſie of Cerinthus prevailed, and, that they were Gnoſticks. The beginning of the Encratites under the Apostles. It is evident that one God in Trinity was then glorified among the Christians, by the Fullneſſe of the Godhead which they introduced in ſtead of it.

      * CHAP. XIII. The Word was at the beginning of all things. The apparitions of the Old Teſtament Prefaces to the Incarnation of Chriſt. Ambaſſadors are not honoured with the honour due to their Maſters. The Word of God that was afterwards incarnate was in thoſe Angels that ſpoke in Gods Name. No Angel honoured as God under the New Teſtament. The Word was with God at the beginning of all things, as after his return.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Name of God not aſcribed to Chriſt for the like reaſon as to creatures. The reaſons why the Socinians worſhip Chriſt as God do confute their limitations. Chriſt not God by virtue of his riſing againe. He is the Great God with S. Paul, the true God, with S. John, the onely Lord, with S. Jude. Other Scriptures. Of the forme of God, and of a ſervant in S. Paul.

      * CHAP. XV. Not onely the Church but the World was made by Chriſt. The Word was made fleſh in oppoſition to the Spirit. How the Prophets, how Chriſtians, by receiving the Word of God, are poſſeſſed by his Spirit. How the title of Sonne of God importeth the Godhead. How Chriſt is the brightneſſe and Image of God.

      * CHAP. XVI. The teſtimonies of Chriſts Godhead in the Old Teſtament are firſt underſtood of the figures of Chriſt. Of the Wiſdome of God in Solomon and elſewhere. Of the writings of the Jewes as well before as after Chriſt.

      * CHAP. XVII. Anſwer to thoſe texts of Scripture that ſeem to abate the true Godhead in Chriſt. Of that creature whereof Chriſt is the firſt-borne, and that which the Wiſdome of God made. That this beliefe is the originall Tradition of the Church. What meanes this diſpute furniſheth us with againſt the Arrians. That it is reaſon to ſubmit to revelation concerning the nature of God. The uſe of reaſon is no way renounced by holding this Faith.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The neceſſity of the grace of Chriſt, is the evidence of originall ſinne. How the exaltation of our Lord depends upon his humiliation, and the grace of Christ upon that▪ All the work of Chriſtianity is aſcribed to the grace of Chriſt. Gods predeſtination manifeſteth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XIX. Evidences of the ſame in the Old Teſtament; Of Gods help in getting the Land of Promiſe, and renewing the Covenant: And that for Chriſts ſake. That Chriſtianity cannot ſtand without acknowledging the grace of Chriſt. The Tradition of the Church; In the Baptiſme of Infants: In the Prayers of the Church; In the decrees against Pelagius and other records of the Church.

      * CHAP. XX. Wherein Originall ſinne conſiſteth; What opinions are on foot. That it is not Adams ſinne imputed to his poſterity. Whether man were at the firſt created to a ſupernaturall end, or not. An eſtate of meer nature, but innocent, poſſible. Originall ſinne is Concupiſcence. How Baptiſme voids it. Concerning the late novelty in the Church of England about Originall ſinne.

      * CHAP. XXI. The opinion that mak•s the Predetermination of mans will by God the ſourſe of his freedom; And wherein Janſenius differs from it. Of neceſsity upon ſuppoſition & abſolute. The neceſsity of the Will following the last dictate of the underſtanding is onely upon ſuppoſition, As alſo that which Gods foreſight creates. The difference between indifferent and undetermined.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Goſpel findeth man free from neceſſity, though not from bondage. Of the Antecedent and Conſequent Will of God. Praedetermination not the root, but the rooting up of Freedome and of Chriſtianity. Againſt the opinion of Janſenius.

      * CHAP. XXIII. A man is able to doe things truely honeſt under Originall ſin. But not to make God the end of all his doings. How all the actions of the Gentiles are ſins. They are accountable onely for the Law of nature. How all men have or have not Grace ſufficient to ſave.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Though God determineth not the will immediately, yet he determineth the effect thereof by the meanes of his providence, preſenting the object ſo as he foreſees it will chuſe, The caſes of Pharoah, of Solomon, of Ahab, and of the Jewes that crucified Chriſt. Of Gods foreknowledg of future conditionalls that come not to paſſe. The ground of foreknowledg of future contingencies. Difficult objections anſwered.

      * CHAP. XXV. The grounds of the difference between ſufficient and effectuall. How naturall occaſions, conduce to ſupernaturall actions, The inſufficience of Janſenius his doctrine. Of ſufficient grace under the Law of Moſes and Nature.

      * CHAP. XXVI. Predeſtination to grace abſolute, to glory reſpective: Purpoſe of denying effectuall Grace abſolute, of puniſhing reſpective. The end, to which God predeſtinates, is not the end for which he predeſtinates. Grace the reward of the right uſe of Grace. How much of the queſtion the Goſpell determines not. That our indeavours are ingaged no leſſe, then if predeſtination were not, it determineth. Of the Tradition of the Church; and of Semipelagians, Predeſtinatians and Arminians.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The queſtion concerning the ſatisfaction of Chriſt with Socinus. The reaſon why Sacrifices are figures of Chriſt, common to all ſacrifices. Why, and what Sacrifices the Fathers had, what the Law added. Of our ranſom by the price of Chriſts propitiatory Sacrifice.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Chriſt took away our ſinne by bearing the puniſhment of it. The Propheſie of Eſay LIII. We are reconciled to God by the Goſpel, in conſideration of Chriſts obedience. The reconcilement of Jews and Gentiles, Men and Angels, conſequent to the ſame. Of purging and expiating ſinne by Chriſt, and making propitiation for it. Of Chriſts dying for us.

      * CHAP. XXIX. The grant of Grace, in conſideration of Chriſt, ſuppoſes ſatisfaction made by him for ſinne. Neither our ſinnes imputable to Chriſt, nor his ſufferings to us, formally and perſonally, but, as the meritorious cauſes which ſatisfaction anſwereth. The effect of it, the Covenant of Grace, as well as help to performe it. The Fathers ſaved by the Faith of Chriſt to come. The Goſpel a new Law. The property of Satisfaction and Puniſhment in Chriſts ſufferings. Of the ſenſe of the Catholike Church.

      * CHAP. XXX. God might have reconciled man to himſelf without the coming of Chriſt. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend as well upon his active as paſſive obedience. Chriſt need not ſuffer •ell pa•nes that we might not. The opinion that maketh juſtifying Faith to be truſt in God not true; Yet not prejudiciall to the Faith. The decree of the Council of Trent, and the doctrine of the Schoole; how it is not prejudiciall to the Faith. As alſo that of Socinus.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ſtate of the queſtion concerning the perſeverance of thoſe that are once juſtified. Of three ſenſes, one true, one inconſiſtent with the Faith, the third neither true nor yet deſtructive to the Faith. Evidence from the writings of the Apoſtles. From the Old Teſtament. The grace of Propheſie when it preſuppoſeth ſanctifying grace. Anſwer to ſome Texts, and of S. Pauls meaning in the VII. of the Romans. Of the Polygamy of the Fathers. What aſſurance of Grace Chriſtians may have. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How the fullfilling of Gods Law is poſſible, how impoſſible▪ for a Chriſtian. Of the difference between mortall and v•niall ſinne. What love of God and of our neighbour was neceſſary under the Old Teſtament. Whether the S•rmon in the Mount correct the falſe interpretation of the Jewes, or inhanſe the obligation of the Law. Of the difference between matter of Precept and matter of Counſail; and the Perfection of Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Whether any workes of Chriſtians be ſatisfactory for ſinne, and meritorious of heaven, or not. The recovery of Gods grace for a Chriſtian fallen from it, a work of labour and time. The neceſſity and efficacy of Penance to that purpoſe, according to the Scriptures, and the practiſe of the Church. Merit by virtue of Gods promiſe, neceſſary. The Catholicke Church agrees in it, the preſent Church of Rome allowes merit of juſtice▪

      * CHAP. I. The Society of the Church founded upon the duty of communicating in the Offices of Gods Service. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt, among thoſe Offices, proper to Chriſtianity. What opinions, concerning the preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood in the Euchariſt, are on foot.

      * CHAP. II. That the natural ſubſtance of the Elements remains in the Sacrament. That the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is nevertheleſſe preſent in the ſame, when it is received, not by the receiving of it. The eating of the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe neceſſarily requireth the ſame. This cauſes no contradiction nor improperty in the words of our Lord.

      * CHAP. III. That the preſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt depends not upon the living Faith of him that receives, but upon the true profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the Church that celebrates. The Scriptures that are alleged for the dependence of it upon the communication of the properties. They conclude not the ſenſe of them by whom they are alleged. How the Scripture confineth the fleſh of Chriſt to the Heavens.

      * CHAP. IV. The opinion which maketh the Conſecration to be done by rehearſing the operative words. That our Lord conſecrated by Thanksgiving. The Form of it in all Liturgies, together with the conſent of the Fathers. Evidence, that there is no Tradition of the Church for the aboliſhing of the Elements.

      * CHAP. V. It cannot be proved by the Old Teſtament that the Euchariſt is a Sacrifice. How, by the New Teſtament it may be ſo accounted. Four reaſons thereof, depending upon the nature of Juſtifying Faith premiſed. The conſent of the Catholick Church. The concurrence of the Church of England to the premiſes.

      * CHAP. VI. The reaſon of the Order by which I proceed, brings me to the Baptiſm of Infants in the next place. The power of the Keyes ſeen in granting Baptiſm, as well as in communicating the Euchariſt. Why Socinians make Baptiſm indifferent: Why Antinomians make it a miſtake to Baptize. The grounds upon which I ſhake off both: With anſwer to ſome objections.

      * CHAP. VII. The ground of baptizing Infants Originall ſinne, though not inſtituted till Chriſt roſe again. No other cure for it. Infants of Chriſtians may be Diſciples, are holy. The effect of Circumciſion under the Law, inferreth the effect of Baptiſm under the Goſpel.

      * CHAP. VIII. What is alleadged to impeach Tradition for baptizing Infants; Proves not, that any could be ſaved regularly, who dyed unbaptized; but, that, baptizing at yeares was a ſtrong means to make good Chriſtians. Why the Church now Baptize, Infants. What becomes of Infants dying unbaptized, unanſwerable. What thoſe Infants g•t who dye baptized.

      * CHAP. IX. What controverſie the Reformation hath with the Church of Rome about Penance. Inward repentance that is ſincere, obtaineth pardon alone. Remiſſion of ſinnes by the Goſpel onely: The condition of it by the Miniſtrey of the Church. What the power of binding and looſing contains more then Preaching, or taking away offenſes. Sinne may be pardoned without the uſe of it. Wherein the neceſſity of uſing it lyeth.

      * CHAP. X. The Sects of the Montaniſts, Novations, Donatiſts, and Meletians, evidence the cure of ſinne by Penance, to be a Tradition of the Apoſtles. So doth the agreement of primitive practice with their writings. Indulgence of regular Penance from the Apoſtles. Confeſſion of ſecret ſinnes in the Primitive Church. That no ſinne can be cured without the Keyes of the Church, there is no Tradition from the Apoſtles. The neceſſity of confeſſing ſecret ſinnes, whereupon it ſtands.

      * CHAP. IX. Penance is not required to redeem tho debt of temporall puniſhment when the ſinne is pardoned. What aſſurance of forgiveneſſe, the law of auricular Confeſſion, as it is uſed in the Church of Rome, procureth Of injoyning Penance, after abſolution performed. Setting aſide abuſes, the Law is agreeable to Gods. Of the order taken by the Church of England.

      * CHAP. XI. The Unction of the ſick pretendeth onely bodily health, upon ſuppoſition of the cure of ſinne by the Keyes of the Church. Objections anſwered. The Tradition of the Church evidenceth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XII. The ground of the Right of the Church in Matrimonial cauſes. Mariage of one with one inſolubly is a Law of Chriſtianity; The Law of Moſes not injoyning it. The Law of the Empire not aiming at the ground of it. Evidence from the primitive practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XIV. Scripture alleged to prove the bond of Mariage inſoluble in caſe of adultery, uneffectuall. S. Paul and our Lord ſpeak both to one purpoſe, according to S. Jerome, and S. Auſtine. The contrary opinion more reaſonable, and more general in the Church. Why the Church may reſtrain the innocent party from marying again. The Imperial Lawes could never be of force to void the Power of the Church. Evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIV. Another opinion, admitting the ground of lawfull Impediments. What Impediments ariſe upon the Conſtitution of the Church, generally as a Society, or particularly, as of Chriſtians. By what Law ſome degrees are prohibited Chriſtians. And, of the Polygamy of the Patriarchs. Mariage with the deceaſed wives Siſter, and with a Couſin Germane, by what Law prohibited.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power given the XII. under the Title of Apoſtles, and the LXX. Diſciples. That the VII were Deacons. Of the firſt Presbyters at Jeruſalem, and the Intereſt of the People. Presbyters appropriated to Churches, under the Apoſtles. S. Pauls Deacons no Presbyters. No ground for Lay Flders.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The Apoſtles all of oequall power; S. Peter onely chiefe in managing it. The ground for the pre-•minence of Churches, before and over Churches. Of Alexandria, Antiochia, Jeruſalem and Rome. Ground for the pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, before all Churches. The conſequence of that Ground. A ſummary of the evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIX. Of the proceedings about Marcion and Montanus at Rome. The buſineſse of Pope Victor about keeping Eaſter; a peremptory inſtance. The buſineſſe of the Novatians evidenceth the ſame. Of the buſineſſes concerning the rebaptizing of Hereticks, Dionyſius of Alexandria, Paulus Samoſatenus, S. Cypriane, and, of the Donatiſts under Conſtantine.

      * CHAP. XX. Of the conſtitution and authority of Councils. The ground of the pre-eminences of Churches in the Romane Empire. The VI. Canon of the Council of Nicaea. The pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, and that of Conſtantinople. Some inſtances againſt the ſuperiority of Biſhops, out of the records of the Church; what offices every Order by Gods Law, or by Canon Law, miniſtreth.

      * CHAP. XXI. Of the times of God ſervice; By what Title of his Law the firſt day of the week is kept Holy. How the Sabbath is to be ſanctified by Moſes Law.

Of the difference of meats, and meaſure of Faſting. Of the keeping o four Lords Birthday, and other Feſtivals, and the regular hours of the day for Gods ſervice.

      * CHAP. XXII. The people of God •ied to build Synagogues, though not by the leter of the Law. The Church to provide Churches, though the Scripture command it not. Preſcribing the form of Gods publick ſervice, is not quenching the Spirit. The Pſalter is preſcribed the Church for Gods Praiſes. The Scriptures preſcribed to be read in the Church; The Order of reading them to be preſcribed by the Church.

      * CHAP. XXIII. The conſideration of the Euchariſt preſcribed by Tradition, for the mater of it. Lords Prayer preſcribed in all ſervices. The mater of Prayers for all eſtates preſcribed. The form of Baptiſm neceſſary to be preſcribed. The ſame reaſon holdeth in the forms of other Offices.

      * CHAP. XXIV. The Service of God to be preſcribed in a known Language. No pretenſe that the Latine is now underſtood. The means to preſerve Unity in the Church, notwithſtanding. The true reaſon of a Sacrifice inforceth Communion in the Euchariſt. What occaſions may diſpenſe in it. Communion in both kindes commanded the People. Objections anſwered. Who is chargeable with the abuſe.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Prayer the more principall Office of Gods ſervice then Preaching. Preachings, neither Gods word, nor the meanes of ſalvation, unleſſe limited to the Faith of Gods Church. What, the edification of the Church by preaching further requires. The Order for Divine ſervice according to the courſe of the Church of England; According to the cuſtome of the univerſall Church.

      * CHAP. XXV. Idolatry preſuppoſeth an immagination that there is more Gods then one. Objections out of the ſcripture that it is the worſhip of a true God under an Image. the Originall of worſhipping the elements of the world: The Devil: And Images. Of the Idolatry of the Magicians, and of the Gnosticks. What Idolatry the caſes of Aron and of Jer•boam involve. Of the Idolatries practiſed under the Kings and Judges, in anſwer to objections.

      * CHAP. XXVI. The Place, or rather the State of happy and miſerable Soules otherwiſe underſtood by Gods people before Chriſts aſcenſion, then after it. What the Apocalypſe, what the reſt of the Apoſtles declare. Onely Martyrs before Gods Throne. Of the ſight of God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The Soules of the Fathers were not in the Devils Power till Chriſt; Though the Old Teſtament declare not their eſtate. Of Samuels ſoul. The ſoul of our Lord Chriſt, parting from his body, went with the Thiefe to Paradiſe. Of his triumph over the powers of darkneſſe. Prayer for the dead ſignifieth no delivering of ſoules out of Purgatory. The Covenant of Grace requires imperfect happineſſe before the generall judgement. Of forgiveneſſe in the world to come, and, paying the utmoſt farthing.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Ancient opinions in the Church, of the place of ſoules before the day of judgement. No Tradition that the Fathers were in the Ʋerge of Hell, under the Earth. The reaſon of the difference in the expreſſions of the Fathers of the Church. What Tradition of the Church for the place of Christs ſoule, during his death, The Saints ſoules in ſecret manſions, according to the Tradition of the Church. Prayer for the dead ſuppoſeth the ſame.

Three ſorts of prayers to Saints: The firſt, agreeable with Chriſtianity: The laſt may be Idolatry: The ſecond a ſtep to it. Of the Reliques of the Saints Bodies. What the ſecond Commandement prohibiteth or alloweth. The ſecond Councile of Nicea doth not decree Idolatry; And yet there is no decree in the Church for the worſhiping of Images.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ground for a Monaſticall life in the Scriptures; And in the practice of the primitive Church. The Church getteth no peculiar intereſt in them who profeſſe it, by their profeſſing of it. The nature and intent of it renders it ſubordinate to the Clergy. How farre the ſingle life of the Clergy hath been a Law to the Church. Inexecution of the Canons for it. Nullity of the proceeddings of the Church of Rome in it. The intereſt of the People in the acts of the Church; And in the uſe of the Scriptures.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How great the Power of the Church, and the effect of it is. The right of judging the cauſes of Chriſtians c•aſeth, when it is protected by the State. An Objection; If Eccl•ſiaſticall Power were from God, Secular Power could not limit the uſe of it. Ground for the Intereſt of the State in Church matters. The inconſequence of the argument. The concurrence of both Intereſts to the Law of the Church. The Intereſt of the State in the indowment of the Church. Concurrence of both in matrimoniall cauſes, and Ordinations.

The infinite Power of the Pope not founded upon acts of Epiſcopacy, but upon the Secular Powers of Chriſtendome.

    _ The ſecond BOOK.

      * CHAP. I. All agree, that Reaſon is to decide controverſies of Faith. The objection, that Faith is taught by Gods Spirit, anſwered. What Reaſon decideth queſtions of Faith. The reſolution of Faith ends not in the light of Reaſon, but in that which Reaſon evidenceth to come from Gods meſſengers.

      * CHAP. II. The queſtion between the Scripture and the Church, which of them is Judge in matters of Faith. Whether opinion, the Tradition of the Church ſtands better with. Thoſe that hold the Scripture to be clear in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, have no reaſon to exclude the Tradition of the Church. What opinions they are, that deny the Church to be a Society or Corporation by Gods Law.

      * CHAP. III. That neither the ſentence of the Church, nor the dictate of Gods Spirit, can be the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be received. No man can know that hee hath Gods Spirit, without knowing that hee is a true Chriſtian; Which ſuppoſeth the truth of the Scripture. The motives of Faith are the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be believed: And the conſent of Gods people the reaſon that evidences thoſe motives to be infallibly true. How the Scriptures are believed for themſelves. How a Circle is made in rendering a reaſon of the Faith. The Scriptures are Gods Law to all, to whom they are publiſhed, by Gods act of publiſhing them; But Civil Law, by the act of Soveraign Powers, in acting Chriſtianity upon their Subjects.

      * CHAP. IV. Neither the Dictate of Gods Spirit nor the authority of the Church is the reaſon of believing any thing in Chriſtianity. Whether the Church be before the Scripture, or the Scripture before the Church. The Scriptures contain not the Infallibility of the Church. Nor the conſent of all Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. V. All things neceſſary to ſalvation are not clear in the Scriptures to all underſtandings. Not in the Old Teſtament. Not in the Goſpel. Not in the Writings of the Apoſtles. It is neceſſary to ſalvation to believe more than this, that our Lord is the Chriſt. Time cauſeth obſcurity in the Scriptures, aſwell as in other Records. That it is no where ſaid in the Scriptures, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are clear in the Scriptures. Neither is there any conſent of all Chriſtians to evidence the ſame.

      * CHAP. VI. All interpretation of Scripture is to be confined within the Tradition of the Church. This ſuppoſeth that the Church is a Communion inſtituted by God. What means there is to make evidence of Gods Charter, upon which the Corporation of the Church ſubſiſteth. The name of the Church, in the Scriptures, often ſignifieth the Whole or Cathelick Church.

      * CHAP. VII. That the Apoſtles delivered to the Church a Summary of Chriſtianity, which, all ſhould be baptized were to profeſs. Evidence out of the Scriptures. Evidence out of the Scriptures for Tradition regulating the Communion of the Church, and the Order of it. Evidence for the Rule of Faith, out of the records of the Church. For the Canons of the Church, and the pedegree of them from the Order eſtabliſhed in the Church by the Apoſtles. That the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and that by being baptized, is neceſſary to the ſalvation of a Chriſtian.

      * CHAP. VIII. That the Power of Governing the whole Church was in the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, and thoſe whom they took to aſſiſt them in the parts of it. The Power of their Succeſſors muſt needs be derived from thoſe. Why that Succeſſion which appeares in one Church, neceſſarily holdeth all Churches. The holding of Councils evidenceth the Ʋnity of the Church.

      * CHAP. IX. The Keyes of the Church given the Apoſtles, and exerciſed by Excommunication under the Apoſtles. The ground thereof is that profeſſion, which, all that are baptized are to make. That Penance and abatemeut of Penance hath been in force ever ſince and under the Apoſtles. In particular, of excluding Hereticks.

      * CHAP. X. Evidence of the Apoſtles act from the effect of it, in preſerving the Ʋnity of the Church. Of the buſineſſe of Marcion and Montanus. That about keeping Eaſter. That of the Novations, of rebaptizing Hereticks, of Paulus Samoſatenus, of Dionyſius Alexandrinus, and Arius. Of communicatory leters, and the intercourſe of the Church under and after the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. XI.Ʋpon what grounds the firſt book de Synedriis holds that the Church cannot excommunicate. Before the Law there was no ſuch Power, nor by it. Chriſtians went for Jewes under the Apoſtles. His ſenſe of ſome Scriptures. What the Leviatha• ſaith in general concerning the Power of the Church. Both ſuppoſe that Eccleſiaſtical Power includeth Temporal, which is not true. Of the Oxford Doctors Paraeneſis.

      * CHAP. XII. That the Law experſly covenanted for the Land of Promiſe. A great Objection againſt this, from the Great precept of the Law. The hope of the world to come under the Law, and the obedience which it requireth, was grounded upon reaſon from the true God, the Tradition of the Fathers, and the Doctrine of the Prophets. The Love of God above all by the Law extendeth no further than the precepts of the Law, the love of our Neighbor onely to Jewes. Of the Ceremonial, Judicial and Moral Law.

      * CHAP. XIII. That the Law tendreth no other promiſe but that of the Land of Canaan. How the Reſurrection is ſignified by the Prophets. Expreſſe texts of the Apoſtles. Their arguments, and the arguments of our Lord do ſuppoſe the myſtical ſenſe of the Scriptures. That this ſenſe is to be made good throughout the Scripture, whereſoever the ground of it takes place; Chriſtianity well grounded ſuppoſing this. What parts of Scripture may be queſtionable, whether they have a myſtical ſenſe or not. The ſayings and doings of our Lord have it; As alſo thoſe paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which are fulfilled by the ſame. The ſenſe of the Fathers.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Leviathans opin•on, that Chriſt came to reſtore that kingdome of God which the Jewes caſt off when they rejected Samuel. It overthroweth the foundation of Chriſtianity. The true Government of Gods ancient people. The name of the Church in the New Teſtament cannot ſignifie the Synagogue. Nor any Chriſtian State.

      * CHAP. XV. How the Power of the Church is founded upon the Law. The Power of the Kingdome, Prieſthood, Prophets, and Rulers of that people all of divine right. How farre theſe qualities and the powers of them are to continue in the Church. The ſenſe of the Fathers in this point. That the acts of S. Paul and the reſt of the Apoſtles were not of force by virtue of the Law. What Eccleſiaſtical Power ſhould have been among the Jewes, in caſe they had received the Goſpel, and ſo the State had ſtood.

      * CHAP. XVI. The Church founded upon the Power given the Apoſtles. What is the ſubject mater of Church Lawes. The right of the Church to Tithes and Oblations is not grounded upon the Law, though evidenced by it, and by practice of the Patriarchs. Evidence of the Apoſtles Order in the Scriptures. The Church of Jeruſalem held not community of Goods. The original practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power of Excommunication in the Church is not founded in the Law. What argument there is of it in the Old Teſtament. The allegorical ſenſe thereof is argumentative. It was not neceſſary that the Chriſtians ſhould incurre perſecution for uſing the Power of the Keyes, and not by virtue of the Law.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The difference between S. Pauls anathema and that of the Jewes. It is not neceſſary that the Chriſtians anathema ſhould ſignifie curſing. That the inceſtuous perſon at Corinth was Excommunicated by S. Paul. Juriſdiction of the Church. Telling the Church, binding and looſing, holding him that is bound for a Heathen or a Publicane, ſigniſie the ſame. The coherence of our Lords diſcourſe. Of Excommunication and Indulgence by private perſons in the Ancient Church. That Excommunication and the Power of the Church could not come in force by the voluntary conſent of the firſt Chriſtians. How it may be ſaid to be voluntary. Of the confederacy of the primitive Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XIX. That Power which was in Churches under the Apoſtles, can never be in any Chriſtian Soveraign. The difference between the Church and the Synagogue in that regard. The intereſt of Secular Power in determining maters of Faith preſuppoſeth the Society of the Church, and the act of it. No man can be bound to profeſſe the contrary of that which hee believeth. Every man is bound to profeſſe that Chriſtianity which hee believeth. The Church is the chief Teacher of Chriſtianity through Chriſtendom, as the Soveraign of Civil Peace, thorough his Dominions. Why the Church is to decide maters of Faith rather than the State, neither being infallible.

      * CHAP. XX. The reſt of the Oxford Doctors pretenſe. The Power of binding and looſing ſuppoſeth not onely the Preaching of the Goſpel, but the outward act of Faith. Chriſtians are not at liberty to caſt themſelves into what formes of Churches the Law of Nature alloweth. They are Judges in chief for themſelves in mater of Religion, ſuppoſing the Catholick Church; not otherwiſe. Secular Power cannot puniſh for Religion, but ſuppoſing the act of the Church, nor do any act to inforce Religion, unleſſe the Church determine the mater of it.

      * CHAP. XXI. How the Tradition of the Church limits the interpretation of Scriptures. How the declaration of the Church becomes a reaſonable mark of Hereſie. That which is not found in the Scriptures may have been delivered by the Apoſtles. Some things delivered by the Apoſtles, and recorded in the Scriptures; may not oblige. S. Auſtines Rule of Apoſtolical Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Authority of the Fathers is not grounded upon any preſumption of their Learning or Holineſſe. How farr they challenge the credit of Hiſtorical truth. The pre-eminenee of the Primitive. The preſumption that is grounded upon their ranks and qualities in the Church. Of Arnobius, Lactantius, Tertullian, Origen, Clemens, and the approbation of poſterity.

      * CHAP. XXIII. Two inſtances againſt the premiſes, beſides the objection concerning the beginning of Antichriſt under the Apoſtles. The general anſwer to it. The ſeven Trumpets in the Apocalypſe fore-tell the deſtruction of the Jewes. The ſeven Vials, the plagues inflicted upon the Empire for the ten perſecutions. The correſpondence of Deniels Propheſie inferreth the ſame. Neither S. Pauls Prophe••e nor S. Johns concerneth any Chriſtian. Neither the opinion of the Chiliaſts, nor the giving of the Euchariſt to Infants new Baptized, Catholick.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Two ſorts of means to reſolve whatſoever is reſolvable concerning the Scripture. Upon what terms the Church may, or is to determine controverſies of Faith. And what obligation that determination produceth. Traditions of the Apoſtles oblige the preſent Church, as the reaſons of them continue or not. Inſtances in our Lords Paſſeover and Euchariſt. Penance under the Apoſtles, and afterwards. S. Pauls vail, eating blood, and things offered to Idols. The power of the Church in limiting theſe Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXV. The power of the Church in limiting even the Traditions of the Apoſtles. Not every abuſe of this power, a ſufficient warrant for particular Churches to reforme themſelves. Hereſie conſiſts in denying ſomething, neceſſary to ſalvation to be believed. Schiſm, in departing from the unity of the Church, whether upon that, or any other cauſe. Implicite Faith no virtue; but the effect of it may be the work of Chriſtian charity.

      * CHAP. XXVI. What it is to adde to Gods Law; What to adde the Apocalypſe. S. Pauls Anathema. The Beraeans. S. Johns Goſpel ſufficient to make one believe; and the Scriptures, The man of God perfit. How the Law giveth light, and Chriſtians are taught by God. How Idolatry is ſaid, not to be commanded by God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. Why it was death to tranſgreſs the determinations of the Jews Conſiſtory, and what power this argueth in the Church. A difference between the authority of the Apoſtles, and that of the Church. The being of the Church to the worlds end, with power of the Keyes, makes it not infallible. Obedience to Superiors, and the Pillar of truth inferre it not.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The Fathers acknowledge the Sufficience and clearneſs of the Scriptures, as, the Traditions of the Church. They are to be reconciled, by limiting the terms which they uſe. The limitation of thoſe ſayings which make all Chriſtian truth to be contained in the Scriptures. Of thoſe which make the authority of the Church the ground of Faith.

      * CHAP. XXXII. Anſwer to an Objection, that choice of Religion becomes difficult upon theſe terms. This reſolution is for the Intereſt of the Reformation. Thoſe that make the Church Infallible cannot, thoſe that make the Scripture clear and ſufficient may own Tradition for evidence to determine the meaning of the Scriptures, and Controverſies of Faith. The Intereſt of the Church of England. The pretenſe of Ruſhworthes Dialogues, that wee have no unqueſtionable Scripture, and, that the Tradition of the Church never changes.

      * CHAP. XXXI. That the Scriptures which wee have are unqueſtionable. That miſtakes in Copying are not conſiderable to the ſenſe and effect of them. The meaning of the Hebrew and Greek, even of the Prophets, determinable, to the deciding of Controverſies. How Religion delivered by Tradition becomes ſubject to be corrupted.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. The Diſpute concerning the Canon of Scripture, and the tranſlations thereof, in two Queſtions. There can be no Tradition for thoſe books that were written ſince Propheſie ceaſed. Wherein the excellence of them above other books lies. The chief objections againſt them are queſtionable. In thoſe parcels of the New Teſtament that have been queſtioned, the caſe is not the ſame. The ſenſe of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Onely the Original Copy can be Authentick. But, the truth thereof may as well be found in the tranſlations of the Old Teſtament, as in the Jewes Copies. The Jewes have not falſified them of malice. The Points come neither from Moſes, nor Eſdras, but from the Talmud Jewes.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. Of the anci•n eſt Tranſlations of the Bible into Greek firſt; With the Authors and authority of the ſame; Then into the Chaldee, Syriack, and Latine. Exceptions againſt the Greek, and the Samaritane Pentateuch. They are helps nevertheleſs to aſſure the true reading of the Scriptures, though with other Copies; whether Jewiſh or Chriſtian. Though the Vulgar Latine were better than the preſent Greek, yet muſt both depend upon the Original Greek of the New Teſta•ent. No danger to Chriſtianity by the differences remaining in the Bible.

      * CHAP. 1. Two parts of that which remains. How the diſpute concerning the Holy Trinity with Socinus belongs to the firſt. The Queſtion of juſtification by Faith alone. The Opinion of Socinus concerning the whole Covenant of Grace. The opinion of thoſe who make juſtifying Faith the knowledge of a mans Predeſtination, oppoſite to it in the other extream. The difference between it and that of the Antinomians. That there are mean Opinions.

      * CHAP. II. Evidence what is the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. The contract of Baptiſm. The promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt annexed to Chriſts, not to Johns Baptiſm. Thoſe are made Chriſts Diſciples as Chriſtians that take up his Croſſe in Baptiſm. The effects of Baptiſm according to the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. III. The exhortations of the Apoſtles, that are drawn from the patterns of the Old Teſtament, ſuppoſe the ſame. How the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament are the ſame, how not the ſame. How the New Teſtament and the New Covenant are both one. The free-will of man acteth the ſame part in dealing about the New-Covenant, as about the Old. The Gospel a Law.

      * CHAP. IV. The conſent of the whole Church evidenced by the cuſtome of chatechiſing. By the opinion thereof concerning the ſalvation of thoſe that delayed their Baptiſm. By the rites and Ceremonies of Baptiſm. Why no penance for ſins before, but after Baptiſm. The doctrine of the Church of England evident in this caſe.

      * CHAP. V. The Preaching of our Lord and his Apoſtles evidenceth, that ſome act of Mans free choice is the condition which it requireth. The correspondence betwen the Old and New Teſtament inferreth the ſame. So do the errors of Socinians and Antinomians concerning the neceſſity of Baptiſm. Objections deferred.

      * CHAP. VI. Juſtifying Faith ſometimes conſiſts in believing the truth. Sometimes, in truſt in God grounded upon the truth. Somtimes in Chriſtianity, that is in imbracing and profeſſing it. And that in the Fathers as well as in the Scriptures. Of the informed and formed Faith of the Schools.

      * CHAP. VII. The laſt ſignification of Faith is properly justifying Faith. The firſt by a Metonymy of the cauſe: The ſecond of the effect. Thoſe that are not juſtified doe truly believe. The truſt of a Chriſtian preſuppoſeth him to be juſtified. All the promiſes of the Goſpel become due at once by the Covenant of Grace. That, to believe that we are Elect or Juſtified, is not Justifying Faith.

      * CHAP. VIII. The objection from S. Paul; We are not juſtified by the Law nor by Workes, but by Grace and by Faith. Not meant of the Goſpel, and the workes that ſuppoſe it. The queſtion that S. Paul ſpeakes to, is of the Law of Moſes and the Workes of it. He ſets thoſe workes in the ſame rank with the workes of the Gentils by the light of nature. The civil and outward workes of the Law may be done by Gentiles. How the Law is a Pedagogue to Chriſt.

      * CHAP. IX. Of the Faith and Juſtification of Abraham and the Patriarkes, according to the Apoſtles. Of the Prophets and righteous men under the Law. Abraham and Rahab the harlot juſtified by workes, if juſtified by Faith. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend upon works which the Goſpell injoyneth. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. X. What Pelagius queſtioneth concerning the Grace of Chriſt, what Socinus further of the ſtate of Chriſt before his birth. The oppoſition between the firſt and ſecond Adam in S. Paul, evidenceth originall ſinne. Coucupiſcence in the unregenerate, and the inability of the Law to ſubdue it, evict the ſame. The ſecond birth by the holy Ghoſt evidenceth that the first birth propagateth ſinne.

      * CHAP. X. The Old Teſtament chargeth all men as well as the wicked to be ſinfull from the wombe. David complaineth of himſelfe as born in ſinne, no leſſe then the Wiſe man of the children of the Gentiles. How Leviticall Lawes argue the ſame. And temporall death under the Old Teſtament. The book of Wiſdome and the Greek Bible.

It is evident that one God in Trinity was then glorified among the Christians, by the Fullneſſe of the Godhead which they introduced in ſtead of it.

      * CHAP. XIII. The Word was at the beginning of all things. The apparitions of the Old Teſtament Prefaces to the Incarnation of Chriſt. Ambaſſadors are not honoured with the honour due to their Maſters. The Word of God that was afterwards incarnate was in thoſe Angels that ſpoke in Gods Name. No Angel honoured as God under the New Teſtament. The Word was with God at the beginning of all things, as after his return.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Name of God not aſcribed to Chriſt for the like reaſon as to creatures. The reaſons why the Socinians worſhip Chriſt as God do confute their limitations.

Of the forme of God, and of a ſervant in S. Paul.

      * CHAP. XV. Not onely the Church but the World was made by Chriſt. The Word was made fleſh in oppoſition to the Spirit. How the Prophets, how Chriſtians, by receiving the Word of God, are poſſeſſed by his Spirit. How the title of Sonne of God importeth the Godhead. How Chriſt is the brightneſſe and Image of God.

      * CHAP. XVI. The teſtimonies of Chriſts Godhead in the Old Teſtament are firſt underſtood of the figures of Chriſt. Of the Wiſdome of God in Solomon and elſewhere. Of the writings of the Jewes as well before as after Chriſt.

      * CHAP. XVII. Anſwer to thoſe texts of Scripture that ſeem to abate the true Godhead in Chriſt. Of that creature whereof Chriſt is the firſt-borne, and that which the Wiſdome of God made. That this beliefe is the originall Tradition of the Church. What meanes this diſpute furniſheth us with againſt the Arrians. That it is reaſon to ſubmit to revelation concerning the nature of God. The uſe of reaſon is no way renounced by holding this Faith.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The neceſſity of the grace of Chriſt, is the evidence of originall ſinne. How the exaltation of our Lord depends upon his humiliation, and the grace of Christ upon that▪ All the work of Chriſtianity is aſcribed to the grace of Chriſt. Gods predeſtination manifeſteth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XIX. Evidences of the ſame in the Old Teſtament; Of Gods help in getting the Land of Promiſe, and renewing the Covenant: And that for Chriſts ſake.

Whether man were at the firſt created to a ſupernaturall end, or not. An eſtate of meer nature, but innocent, poſſible. Originall ſinne is Concupiſcence. How Baptiſme voids it.

      * CHAP. XXI. The opinion that mak•s the Predetermination of mans will by God the ſourſe of his freedom; And wherein Janſenius differs from it. Of neceſsity upon ſuppoſition & abſolute. The neceſsity of the Will following the last dictate of the underſtanding is onely upon ſuppoſition, As alſo that which Gods foreſight creates. The difference between indifferent and undetermined.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Goſpel findeth man free from neceſſity, though not from bondage. Of the Antecedent and Conſequent Will of God. Praedetermination not the root, but the rooting up of Freedome and of Chriſtianity. Againſt the opinion of Janſenius.

      * CHAP. XXIII. A man is able to doe things truely honeſt under Originall ſin. But not to make God the end of all his doings. How all the actions of the Gentiles are ſins. They are accountable onely for the Law of nature. How all men have or have not Grace ſufficient to ſave.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Though God determineth not the will immediately, yet he determineth the effect thereof by the meanes of his providence, preſenting the object ſo as he foreſees it will chuſe, The caſes of Pharoah, of Solomon, of Ahab, and of the Jewes that crucified Chriſt. Of Gods foreknowledg of future conditionalls that come not to paſſe. The ground of foreknowledg of future contingencies. Difficult objections anſwered.

      * CHAP. XXV. The grounds of the difference between ſufficient and effectuall. How naturall occaſions, conduce to ſupernaturall actions, The inſufficience of Janſenius his doctrine. Of ſufficient grace under the Law of Moſes and Nature.

      * CHAP. XXVI. Predeſtination to grace abſolute, to glory reſpective: Purpoſe of denying effectuall Grace abſolute, of puniſhing reſpective. The end, to which God predeſtinates, is not the end for which he predeſtinates. Grace the reward of the right uſe of Grace. How much of the queſtion the Goſpell determines not. That our indeavours are ingaged no leſſe, then if predeſtination were not, it determineth. Of the Tradition of the Church; and of Semipelagians, Predeſtinatians and Arminians.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The queſtion concerning the ſatisfaction of Chriſt with Socinus. The reaſon why Sacrifices are figures of Chriſt, common to all ſacrifices. Why, and what Sacrifices the Fathers had, what the Law added. Of our ranſom by the price of Chriſts propitiatory Sacrifice.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Chriſt took away our ſinne by bearing the puniſhment of it. The Propheſie of Eſay LIII. We are reconciled to God by the Goſpel, in conſideration of Chriſts obedience. The reconcilement of Jews and Gentiles, Men and Angels, conſequent to the ſame. Of purging and expiating ſinne by Chriſt, and making propitiation for it. Of Chriſts dying for us.

      * CHAP. XXIX. The grant of Grace, in conſideration of Chriſt, ſuppoſes ſatisfaction made by him for ſinne. Neither our ſinnes imputable to Chriſt, nor his ſufferings to us, formally and perſonally, but, as the meritorious cauſes which ſatisfaction anſwereth. The effect of it, the Covenant of Grace, as well as help to performe it. The Fathers ſaved by the Faith of Chriſt to come. The Goſpel a new Law. The property of Satisfaction and Puniſhment in Chriſts ſufferings. Of the ſenſe of the Catholike Church.

      * CHAP. XXX. God might have reconciled man to himſelf without the coming of Chriſt. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend as well upon his active as paſſive obedience. Chriſt need not ſuffer •ell pa•nes that we might not. The opinion that maketh juſtifying Faith to be truſt in God not true; Yet not prejudiciall to the Faith. The decree of the Council of Trent, and the doctrine of the Schoole; how it is not prejudiciall to the Faith. As alſo that of Socinus.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ſtate of the queſtion concerning the perſeverance of thoſe that are once juſtified.

The recovery of Gods grace for a Chriſtian fallen from it, a work of labour and time. The neceſſity and efficacy of Penance to that purpoſe, according to the Scriptures, and the practiſe of the Church. Merit by virtue of Gods promiſe, neceſſary. The Catholicke Church agrees in it, the preſent Church of Rome allowes merit of juſtice▪

      * CHAP. I. The Society of the Church founded upon the duty of communicating in the Offices of Gods Service. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt, among thoſe Offices, proper to Chriſtianity. What opinions, concerning the preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood in the Euchariſt, are on foot.

      * CHAP. II. That the natural ſubſtance of the Elements remains in the Sacrament. That the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is nevertheleſſe preſent in the ſame, when it is received, not by the receiving of it. The eating of the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe neceſſarily requireth the ſame. This cauſes no contradiction nor improperty in the words of our Lord.

      * CHAP. III. That the preſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt depends not upon the living Faith of him that receives, but upon the true profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the Church that celebrates. The Scriptures that are alleged for the dependence of it upon the communication of the properties. They conclude not the ſenſe of them by whom they are alleged. How the Scripture confineth the fleſh of Chriſt to the Heavens.

      * CHAP. IV. The opinion which maketh the Conſecration to be done by rehearſing the operative words. That our Lord conſecrated by Thanksgiving. The Form of it in all Liturgies, together with the conſent of the Fathers. Evidence, that there is no Tradition of the Church for the aboliſhing of the Elements.

      * CHAP. V. It cannot be proved by the Old Teſtament that the Euchariſt is a Sacrifice. How, by the New Teſtament it may be ſo accounted. Four reaſons thereof, depending upon the nature of Juſtifying Faith premiſed. The conſent of the Catholick Church. The concurrence of the Church of England to the premiſes.

      * CHAP. VI. The reaſon of the Order by which I proceed, brings me to the Baptiſm of Infants in the next place. The power of the Keyes ſeen in granting Baptiſm, as well as in communicating the Euchariſt. Why Socinians make Baptiſm indifferent: Why Antinomians make it a miſtake to Baptize. The grounds upon which I ſhake off both: With anſwer to ſome objections.

      * CHAP. VII. The ground of baptizing Infants Originall ſinne, though not inſtituted till Chriſt roſe again. No other cure for it. Infants of Chriſtians may be Diſciples, are holy. The effect of Circumciſion under the Law, inferreth the effect of Baptiſm under the Goſpel.

      * CHAP. VIII. What is alleadged to impeach Tradition for baptizing Infants; Proves not, that any could be ſaved regularly, who dyed unbaptized; but, that, baptizing at yeares was a ſtrong means to make good Chriſtians. Why the Church now Baptize, Infants. What becomes of Infants dying unbaptized, unanſwerable. What thoſe Infants g•t who dye baptized.

      * CHAP. IX. What controverſie the Reformation hath with the Church of Rome about Penance. Inward repentance that is ſincere, obtaineth pardon alone. Remiſſion of ſinnes by the Goſpel onely: The condition of it by the Miniſtrey of the Church. What the power of binding and looſing contains more then Preaching, or taking away offenſes. Sinne may be pardoned without the uſe of it. Wherein the neceſſity of uſing it lyeth.

      * CHAP. X. The Sects of the Montaniſts, Novations, Donatiſts, and Meletians, evidence the cure of ſinne by Penance, to be a Tradition of the Apoſtles. So doth the agreement of primitive practice with their writings. Indulgence of regular Penance from the Apoſtles. Confeſſion of ſecret ſinnes in the Primitive Church. That no ſinne can be cured without the Keyes of the Church, there is no Tradition from the Apoſtles. The neceſſity of confeſſing ſecret ſinnes, whereupon it ſtands.

      * CHAP. IX. Penance is not required to redeem tho debt of temporall puniſhment when the ſinne is pardoned. What aſſurance of forgiveneſſe, the law of auricular Confeſſion, as it is uſed in the Church of Rome, procureth Of injoyning Penance, after abſolution performed. Setting aſide abuſes, the Law is agreeable to Gods. Of the order taken by the Church of England.

      * CHAP. XI. The Unction of the ſick pretendeth onely bodily health, upon ſuppoſition of the cure of ſinne by the Keyes of the Church. Objections anſwered. The Tradition of the Church evidenceth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XII. The ground of the Right of the Church in Matrimonial cauſes. Mariage of one with one inſolubly is a Law of Chriſtianity; The Law of Moſes not injoyning it. The Law of the Empire not aiming at the ground of it. Evidence from the primitive practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XIV. Scripture alleged to prove the bond of Mariage inſoluble in caſe of adultery, uneffectuall. S. Paul and our Lord ſpeak both to one purpoſe, according to S. Jerome, and S. Auſtine. The contrary opinion more reaſonable, and more general in the Church. Why the Church may reſtrain the innocent party from marying again. The Imperial Lawes could never be of force to void the Power of the Church. Evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIV. Another opinion, admitting the ground of lawfull Impediments. What Impediments ariſe upon the Conſtitution of the Church, generally as a Society, or particularly, as of Chriſtians.

Of Alexandria, Antiochia, Jeruſalem and Rome. Ground for the pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, before all Churches. The conſequence of that Ground. A ſummary of the evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIX. Of the proceedings about Marcion and Montanus at Rome. The buſineſse of Pope Victor about keeping Eaſter; a peremptory inſtance. The buſineſſe of the Novatians evidenceth the ſame. Of the buſineſſes concerning the rebaptizing of Hereticks, Dionyſius of Alexandria, Paulus Samoſatenus, S. Cypriane, and, of the Donatiſts under Conſtantine.

      * CHAP. XX. Of the conſtitution and authority of Councils. The ground of the pre-eminences of Churches in the Romane Empire. The VI. Canon of the Council of Nicaea.

      * CHAP. XXII. The people of God •ied to build Synagogues, though not by the leter of the Law. The Church to provide Churches, though the Scripture command it not. Preſcribing the form of Gods publick ſervice, is not quenching the Spirit. The Pſalter is preſcribed the Church for Gods Praiſes.

      * CHAP. XXIII. The conſideration of the Euchariſt preſcribed by Tradition, for the mater of it. Lords Prayer preſcribed in all ſervices. The mater of Prayers for all eſtates preſcribed. The form of Baptiſm neceſſary to be preſcribed. The ſame reaſon holdeth in the forms of other Offices.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Prayer the more principall Office of Gods ſervice then Preaching. Preachings, neither Gods word, nor the meanes of ſalvation, unleſſe limited to the Faith of Gods Church.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The Soules of the Fathers were not in the Devils Power till Chriſt; Though the Old Teſtament declare not their eſtate. Of Samuels ſoul. The ſoul of our Lord Chriſt, parting from his body, went with the Thiefe to Paradiſe. Of his triumph over the powers of darkneſſe. Prayer for the dead ſignifieth no delivering of ſoules out of Purgatory. The Covenant of Grace requires imperfect happineſſe before the generall judgement. Of forgiveneſſe in the world to come, and, paying the utmoſt farthing.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Ancient opinions in the Church, of the place of ſoules before the day of judgement. No Tradition that the Fathers were in the Ʋerge of Hell, under the Earth.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ground for a Monaſticall life in the Scriptures; And in the practice of the primitive Church. The Church getteth no peculiar intereſt in them who profeſſe it, by their profeſſing of it. The nature and intent of it renders it ſubordinate to the Clergy. How farre the ſingle life of the Clergy hath been a Law to the Church. Inexecution of the Canons for it. Nullity of the proceeddings of the Church of Rome in it. The intereſt of the People in the acts of the Church; And in the uſe of the Scriptures.

    _ The Third BOOK.

      * CHAP. I. All agree, that Reaſon is to decide controverſies of Faith. The objection, that Faith is taught by Gods Spirit, anſwered. What Reaſon decideth queſtions of Faith. The reſolution of Faith ends not in the light of Reaſon, but in that which Reaſon evidenceth to come from Gods meſſengers.

      * CHAP. II. The queſtion between the Scripture and the Church, which of them is Judge in matters of Faith. Whether opinion, the Tradition of the Church ſtands better with. Thoſe that hold the Scripture to be clear in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, have no reaſon to exclude the Tradition of the Church. What opinions they are, that deny the Church to be a Society or Corporation by Gods Law.

      * CHAP. III. That neither the ſentence of the Church, nor the dictate of Gods Spirit, can be the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be received. No man can know that hee hath Gods Spirit, without knowing that hee is a true Chriſtian; Which ſuppoſeth the truth of the Scripture. The motives of Faith are the reaſon why the Scriptures are to be believed: And the conſent of Gods people the reaſon that evidences thoſe motives to be infallibly true. How the Scriptures are believed for themſelves. How a Circle is made in rendering a reaſon of the Faith. The Scriptures are Gods Law to all, to whom they are publiſhed, by Gods act of publiſhing them; But Civil Law, by the act of Soveraign Powers, in acting Chriſtianity upon their Subjects.

      * CHAP. IV. Neither the Dictate of Gods Spirit nor the authority of the Church is the reaſon of believing any thing in Chriſtianity. Whether the Church be before the Scripture, or the Scripture before the Church. The Scriptures contain not the Infallibility of the Church. Nor the conſent of all Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. V. All things neceſſary to ſalvation are not clear in the Scriptures to all underſtandings. Not in the Old Teſtament. Not in the Goſpel. Not in the Writings of the Apoſtles. It is neceſſary to ſalvation to believe more than this, that our Lord is the Chriſt. Time cauſeth obſcurity in the Scriptures, aſwell as in other Records. That it is no where ſaid in the Scriptures, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are clear in the Scriptures. Neither is there any conſent of all Chriſtians to evidence the ſame.

      * CHAP. VI. All interpretation of Scripture is to be confined within the Tradition of the Church. This ſuppoſeth that the Church is a Communion inſtituted by God. What means there is to make evidence of Gods Charter, upon which the Corporation of the Church ſubſiſteth. The name of the Church, in the Scriptures, often ſignifieth the Whole or Cathelick Church.

      * CHAP. VII. That the Apoſtles delivered to the Church a Summary of Chriſtianity, which, all ſhould be baptized were to profeſs. Evidence out of the Scriptures. Evidence out of the Scriptures for Tradition regulating the Communion of the Church, and the Order of it. Evidence for the Rule of Faith, out of the records of the Church. For the Canons of the Church, and the pedegree of them from the Order eſtabliſhed in the Church by the Apoſtles. That the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and that by being baptized, is neceſſary to the ſalvation of a Chriſtian.

      * CHAP. VIII. That the Power of Governing the whole Church was in the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, and thoſe whom they took to aſſiſt them in the parts of it. The Power of their Succeſſors muſt needs be derived from thoſe. Why that Succeſſion which appeares in one Church, neceſſarily holdeth all Churches. The holding of Councils evidenceth the Ʋnity of the Church.

      * CHAP. IX. The Keyes of the Church given the Apoſtles, and exerciſed by Excommunication under the Apoſtles. The ground thereof is that profeſſion, which, all that are baptized are to make. That Penance and abatemeut of Penance hath been in force ever ſince and under the Apoſtles. In particular, of excluding Hereticks.

      * CHAP. X. Evidence of the Apoſtles act from the effect of it, in preſerving the Ʋnity of the Church. Of the buſineſſe of Marcion and Montanus. That about keeping Eaſter. That of the Novations, of rebaptizing Hereticks, of Paulus Samoſatenus, of Dionyſius Alexandrinus, and Arius. Of communicatory leters, and the intercourſe of the Church under and after the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. XI.Ʋpon what grounds the firſt book de Synedriis holds that the Church cannot excommunicate. Before the Law there was no ſuch Power, nor by it. Chriſtians went for Jewes under the Apoſtles. His ſenſe of ſome Scriptures. What the Leviatha• ſaith in general concerning the Power of the Church. Both ſuppoſe that Eccleſiaſtical Power includeth Temporal, which is not true. Of the Oxford Doctors Paraeneſis.

      * CHAP. XII. That the Law experſly covenanted for the Land of Promiſe. A great Objection againſt this, from the Great precept of the Law. The hope of the world to come under the Law, and the obedience which it requireth, was grounded upon reaſon from the true God, the Tradition of the Fathers, and the Doctrine of the Prophets. The Love of God above all by the Law extendeth no further than the precepts of the Law, the love of our Neighbor onely to Jewes. Of the Ceremonial, Judicial and Moral Law.

      * CHAP. XIII. That the Law tendreth no other promiſe but that of the Land of Canaan. How the Reſurrection is ſignified by the Prophets. Expreſſe texts of the Apoſtles. Their arguments, and the arguments of our Lord do ſuppoſe the myſtical ſenſe of the Scriptures. That this ſenſe is to be made good throughout the Scripture, whereſoever the ground of it takes place; Chriſtianity well grounded ſuppoſing this. What parts of Scripture may be queſtionable, whether they have a myſtical ſenſe or not. The ſayings and doings of our Lord have it; As alſo thoſe paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which are fulfilled by the ſame. The ſenſe of the Fathers.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Leviathans opin•on, that Chriſt came to reſtore that kingdome of God which the Jewes caſt off when they rejected Samuel. It overthroweth the foundation of Chriſtianity. The true Government of Gods ancient people. The name of the Church in the New Teſtament cannot ſignifie the Synagogue. Nor any Chriſtian State.

      * CHAP. XV. How the Power of the Church is founded upon the Law. The Power of the Kingdome, Prieſthood, Prophets, and Rulers of that people all of divine right. How farre theſe qualities and the powers of them are to continue in the Church. The ſenſe of the Fathers in this point. That the acts of S. Paul and the reſt of the Apoſtles were not of force by virtue of the Law. What Eccleſiaſtical Power ſhould have been among the Jewes, in caſe they had received the Goſpel, and ſo the State had ſtood.

      * CHAP. XVI. The Church founded upon the Power given the Apoſtles. What is the ſubject mater of Church Lawes. The right of the Church to Tithes and Oblations is not grounded upon the Law, though evidenced by it, and by practice of the Patriarchs. Evidence of the Apoſtles Order in the Scriptures. The Church of Jeruſalem held not community of Goods. The original practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power of Excommunication in the Church is not founded in the Law. What argument there is of it in the Old Teſtament. The allegorical ſenſe thereof is argumentative. It was not neceſſary that the Chriſtians ſhould incurre perſecution for uſing the Power of the Keyes, and not by virtue of the Law.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The difference between S. Pauls anathema and that of the Jewes. It is not neceſſary that the Chriſtians anathema ſhould ſignifie curſing. That the inceſtuous perſon at Corinth was Excommunicated by S. Paul. Juriſdiction of the Church. Telling the Church, binding and looſing, holding him that is bound for a Heathen or a Publicane, ſigniſie the ſame. The coherence of our Lords diſcourſe. Of Excommunication and Indulgence by private perſons in the Ancient Church. That Excommunication and the Power of the Church could not come in force by the voluntary conſent of the firſt Chriſtians. How it may be ſaid to be voluntary. Of the confederacy of the primitive Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XIX. That Power which was in Churches under the Apoſtles, can never be in any Chriſtian Soveraign. The difference between the Church and the Synagogue in that regard. The intereſt of Secular Power in determining maters of Faith preſuppoſeth the Society of the Church, and the act of it. No man can be bound to profeſſe the contrary of that which hee believeth. Every man is bound to profeſſe that Chriſtianity which hee believeth. The Church is the chief Teacher of Chriſtianity through Chriſtendom, as the Soveraign of Civil Peace, thorough his Dominions. Why the Church is to decide maters of Faith rather than the State, neither being infallible.

      * CHAP. XX. The reſt of the Oxford Doctors pretenſe. The Power of binding and looſing ſuppoſeth not onely the Preaching of the Goſpel, but the outward act of Faith. Chriſtians are not at liberty to caſt themſelves into what formes of Churches the Law of Nature alloweth. They are Judges in chief for themſelves in mater of Religion, ſuppoſing the Catholick Church; not otherwiſe. Secular Power cannot puniſh for Religion, but ſuppoſing the act of the Church, nor do any act to inforce Religion, unleſſe the Church determine the mater of it.

      * CHAP. XXI. How the Tradition of the Church limits the interpretation of Scriptures. How the declaration of the Church becomes a reaſonable mark of Hereſie. That which is not found in the Scriptures may have been delivered by the Apoſtles. Some things delivered by the Apoſtles, and recorded in the Scriptures; may not oblige. S. Auſtines Rule of Apoſtolical Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Authority of the Fathers is not grounded upon any preſumption of their Learning or Holineſſe. How farr they challenge the credit of Hiſtorical truth. The pre-eminenee of the Primitive. The preſumption that is grounded upon their ranks and qualities in the Church. Of Arnobius, Lactantius, Tertullian, Origen, Clemens, and the approbation of poſterity.

      * CHAP. XXIII. Two inſtances againſt the premiſes, beſides the objection concerning the beginning of Antichriſt under the Apoſtles. The general anſwer to it. The ſeven Trumpets in the Apocalypſe fore-tell the deſtruction of the Jewes. The ſeven Vials, the plagues inflicted upon the Empire for the ten perſecutions. The correſpondence of Deniels Propheſie inferreth the ſame. Neither S. Pauls Prophe••e nor S. Johns concerneth any Chriſtian. Neither the opinion of the Chiliaſts, nor the giving of the Euchariſt to Infants new Baptized, Catholick.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Two ſorts of means to reſolve whatſoever is reſolvable concerning the Scripture. Upon what terms the Church may, or is to determine controverſies of Faith. And what obligation that determination produceth. Traditions of the Apoſtles oblige the preſent Church, as the reaſons of them continue or not. Inſtances in our Lords Paſſeover and Euchariſt. Penance under the Apoſtles, and afterwards. S. Pauls vail, eating blood, and things offered to Idols. The power of the Church in limiting theſe Traditions.

      * CHAP. XXV. The power of the Church in limiting even the Traditions of the Apoſtles. Not every abuſe of this power, a ſufficient warrant for particular Churches to reforme themſelves. Hereſie conſiſts in denying ſomething, neceſſary to ſalvation to be believed. Schiſm, in departing from the unity of the Church, whether upon that, or any other cauſe. Implicite Faith no virtue; but the effect of it may be the work of Chriſtian charity.

      * CHAP. XXVI. What it is to adde to Gods Law; What to adde the Apocalypſe. S. Pauls Anathema. The Beraeans. S. Johns Goſpel ſufficient to make one believe; and the Scriptures, The man of God perfit. How the Law giveth light, and Chriſtians are taught by God. How Idolatry is ſaid, not to be commanded by God.

      * CHAP. XXVII. Why it was death to tranſgreſs the determinations of the Jews Conſiſtory, and what power this argueth in the Church. A difference between the authority of the Apoſtles, and that of the Church. The being of the Church to the worlds end, with power of the Keyes, makes it not infallible. Obedience to Superiors, and the Pillar of truth inferre it not.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The Fathers acknowledge the Sufficience and clearneſs of the Scriptures, as, the Traditions of the Church. They are to be reconciled, by limiting the terms which they uſe. The limitation of thoſe ſayings which make all Chriſtian truth to be contained in the Scriptures. Of thoſe which make the authority of the Church the ground of Faith.

      * CHAP. XXXII. Anſwer to an Objection, that choice of Religion becomes difficult upon theſe terms. This reſolution is for the Intereſt of the Reformation. Thoſe that make the Church Infallible cannot, thoſe that make the Scripture clear and ſufficient may own Tradition for evidence to determine the meaning of the Scriptures, and Controverſies of Faith. The Intereſt of the Church of England. The pretenſe of Ruſhworthes Dialogues, that wee have no unqueſtionable Scripture, and, that the Tradition of the Church never changes.

      * CHAP. XXXI. That the Scriptures which wee have are unqueſtionable. That miſtakes in Copying are not conſiderable to the ſenſe and effect of them. The meaning of the Hebrew and Greek, even of the Prophets, determinable, to the deciding of Controverſies. How Religion delivered by Tradition becomes ſubject to be corrupted.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. The Diſpute concerning the Canon of Scripture, and the tranſlations thereof, in two Queſtions. There can be no Tradition for thoſe books that were written ſince Propheſie ceaſed. Wherein the excellence of them above other books lies. The chief objections againſt them are queſtionable. In thoſe parcels of the New Teſtament that have been queſtioned, the caſe is not the ſame. The ſenſe of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Onely the Original Copy can be Authentick. But, the truth thereof may as well be found in the tranſlations of the Old Teſtament, as in the Jewes Copies. The Jewes have not falſified them of malice. The Points come neither from Moſes, nor Eſdras, but from the Talmud Jewes.

      * CHAP. XXXIV. Of the anci•n eſt Tranſlations of the Bible into Greek firſt; With the Authors and authority of the ſame; Then into the Chaldee, Syriack, and Latine. Exceptions againſt the Greek, and the Samaritane Pentateuch. They are helps nevertheleſs to aſſure the true reading of the Scriptures, though with other Copies; whether Jewiſh or Chriſtian. Though the Vulgar Latine were better than the preſent Greek, yet muſt both depend upon the Original Greek of the New Teſta•ent. No danger to Chriſtianity by the differences remaining in the Bible.

      * CHAP. 1. Two parts of that which remains. How the diſpute concerning the Holy Trinity with Socinus belongs to the firſt. The Queſtion of juſtification by Faith alone. The Opinion of Socinus concerning the whole Covenant of Grace. The opinion of thoſe who make juſtifying Faith the knowledge of a mans Predeſtination, oppoſite to it in the other extream. The difference between it and that of the Antinomians. That there are mean Opinions.

      * CHAP. II. Evidence what is the Condition of the Covenant of Grace. The contract of Baptiſm. The promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt annexed to Chriſts, not to Johns Baptiſm. Thoſe are made Chriſts Diſciples as Chriſtians that take up his Croſſe in Baptiſm. The effects of Baptiſm according to the Apoſtles.

      * CHAP. III. The exhortations of the Apoſtles, that are drawn from the patterns of the Old Teſtament, ſuppoſe the ſame. How the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament are the ſame, how not the ſame. How the New Teſtament and the New Covenant are both one. The free-will of man acteth the ſame part in dealing about the New-Covenant, as about the Old. The Gospel a Law.

      * CHAP. IV. The conſent of the whole Church evidenced by the cuſtome of chatechiſing. By the opinion thereof concerning the ſalvation of thoſe that delayed their Baptiſm. By the rites and Ceremonies of Baptiſm. Why no penance for ſins before, but after Baptiſm. The doctrine of the Church of England evident in this caſe.

      * CHAP. V. The Preaching of our Lord and his Apoſtles evidenceth, that ſome act of Mans free choice is the condition which it requireth. The correspondence betwen the Old and New Teſtament inferreth the ſame. So do the errors of Socinians and Antinomians concerning the neceſſity of Baptiſm. Objections deferred.

      * CHAP. VI. Juſtifying Faith ſometimes conſiſts in believing the truth. Sometimes, in truſt in God grounded upon the truth. Somtimes in Chriſtianity, that is in imbracing and profeſſing it. And that in the Fathers as well as in the Scriptures. Of the informed and formed Faith of the Schools.

      * CHAP. VII. The laſt ſignification of Faith is properly justifying Faith. The firſt by a Metonymy of the cauſe: The ſecond of the effect. Thoſe that are not juſtified doe truly believe. The truſt of a Chriſtian preſuppoſeth him to be juſtified. All the promiſes of the Goſpel become due at once by the Covenant of Grace. That, to believe that we are Elect or Juſtified, is not Justifying Faith.

      * CHAP. VIII. The objection from S. Paul; We are not juſtified by the Law nor by Workes, but by Grace and by Faith. Not meant of the Goſpel, and the workes that ſuppoſe it. The queſtion that S. Paul ſpeakes to, is of the Law of Moſes and the Workes of it. He ſets thoſe workes in the ſame rank with the workes of the Gentils by the light of nature. The civil and outward workes of the Law may be done by Gentiles. How the Law is a Pedagogue to Chriſt.

      * CHAP. IX. Of the Faith and Juſtification of Abraham and the Patriarkes, according to the Apoſtles. Of the Prophets and righteous men under the Law. Abraham and Rahab the harlot juſtified by workes, if juſtified by Faith. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend upon works which the Goſpell injoyneth. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. X. What Pelagius queſtioneth concerning the Grace of Chriſt, what Socinus further of the ſtate of Chriſt before his birth. The oppoſition between the firſt and ſecond Adam in S. Paul, evidenceth originall ſinne. Coucupiſcence in the unregenerate, and the inability of the Law to ſubdue it, evict the ſame. The ſecond birth by the holy Ghoſt evidenceth that the first birth propagateth ſinne.

      * CHAP. X. The Old Teſtament chargeth all men as well as the wicked to be ſinfull from the wombe. David complaineth of himſelfe as born in ſinne, no leſſe then the Wiſe man of the children of the Gentiles. How Leviticall Lawes argue the ſame. And temporall death under the Old Teſtament. The book of Wiſdome and the Greek Bible.

      * CHAP. XII. The Haereſie of Simon Magus the beginning of the Gnoſticks. That they were in being during the Apoſtles time. Where and when the Haereſie of Cerinthus prevailed, and, that they were Gnoſticks. The beginning of the Encratites under the Apostles. It is evident that one God in Trinity was then glorified among the Christians, by the Fullneſſe of the Godhead which they introduced in ſtead of it.

      * CHAP. XIII. The Word was at the beginning of all things. The apparitions of the Old Teſtament Prefaces to the Incarnation of Chriſt. Ambaſſadors are not honoured with the honour due to their Maſters. The Word of God that was afterwards incarnate was in thoſe Angels that ſpoke in Gods Name. No Angel honoured as God under the New Teſtament. The Word was with God at the beginning of all things, as after his return.

      * CHAP. XIV. The Name of God not aſcribed to Chriſt for the like reaſon as to creatures. The reaſons why the Socinians worſhip Chriſt as God do confute their limitations. Chriſt not God by virtue of his riſing againe. He is the Great God with S. Paul, the true God, with S. John, the onely Lord, with S. Jude. Other Scriptures. Of the forme of God, and of a ſervant in S. Paul.

      * CHAP. XV. Not onely the Church but the World was made by Chriſt. The Word was made fleſh in oppoſition to the Spirit. How the Prophets, how Chriſtians, by receiving the Word of God, are poſſeſſed by his Spirit. How the title of Sonne of God importeth the Godhead. How Chriſt is the brightneſſe and Image of God.

      * CHAP. XVI. The teſtimonies of Chriſts Godhead in the Old Teſtament are firſt underſtood of the figures of Chriſt. Of the Wiſdome of God in Solomon and elſewhere. Of the writings of the Jewes as well before as after Chriſt.

      * CHAP. XVII. Anſwer to thoſe texts of Scripture that ſeem to abate the true Godhead in Chriſt. Of that creature whereof Chriſt is the firſt-borne, and that which the Wiſdome of God made. That this beliefe is the originall Tradition of the Church. What meanes this diſpute furniſheth us with againſt the Arrians. That it is reaſon to ſubmit to revelation concerning the nature of God. The uſe of reaſon is no way renounced by holding this Faith.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The neceſſity of the grace of Chriſt, is the evidence of originall ſinne. How the exaltation of our Lord depends upon his humiliation, and the grace of Christ upon that▪ All the work of Chriſtianity is aſcribed to the grace of Chriſt. Gods predeſtination manifeſteth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XIX. Evidences of the ſame in the Old Teſtament; Of Gods help in getting the Land of Promiſe, and renewing the Covenant: And that for Chriſts ſake. That Chriſtianity cannot ſtand without acknowledging the grace of Chriſt. The Tradition of the Church; In the Baptiſme of Infants: In the Prayers of the Church; In the decrees against Pelagius and other records of the Church.

      * CHAP. XX. Wherein Originall ſinne conſiſteth; What opinions are on foot. That it is not Adams ſinne imputed to his poſterity. Whether man were at the firſt created to a ſupernaturall end, or not. An eſtate of meer nature, but innocent, poſſible. Originall ſinne is Concupiſcence. How Baptiſme voids it. Concerning the late novelty in the Church of England about Originall ſinne.

      * CHAP. XXI. The opinion that mak•s the Predetermination of mans will by God the ſourſe of his freedom; And wherein Janſenius differs from it. Of neceſsity upon ſuppoſition & abſolute. The neceſsity of the Will following the last dictate of the underſtanding is onely upon ſuppoſition, As alſo that which Gods foreſight creates. The difference between indifferent and undetermined.

      * CHAP. XXII. The Goſpel findeth man free from neceſſity, though not from bondage. Of the Antecedent and Conſequent Will of God. Praedetermination not the root, but the rooting up of Freedome and of Chriſtianity. Againſt the opinion of Janſenius.

      * CHAP. XXIII. A man is able to doe things truely honeſt under Originall ſin. But not to make God the end of all his doings. How all the actions of the Gentiles are ſins. They are accountable onely for the Law of nature. How all men have or have not Grace ſufficient to ſave.

      * CHAP. XXIV. Though God determineth not the will immediately, yet he determineth the effect thereof by the meanes of his providence, preſenting the object ſo as he foreſees it will chuſe, The caſes of Pharoah, of Solomon, of Ahab, and of the Jewes that crucified Chriſt. Of Gods foreknowledg of future conditionalls that come not to paſſe. The ground of foreknowledg of future contingencies. Difficult objections anſwered.

      * CHAP. XXV. The grounds of the difference between ſufficient and effectuall. How naturall occaſions, conduce to ſupernaturall actions, The inſufficience of Janſenius his doctrine. Of ſufficient grace under the Law of Moſes and Nature.

      * CHAP. XXVI. Predeſtination to grace abſolute, to glory reſpective: Purpoſe of denying effectuall Grace abſolute, of puniſhing reſpective. The end, to which God predeſtinates, is not the end for which he predeſtinates. Grace the reward of the right uſe of Grace. How much of the queſtion the Goſpell determines not. That our indeavours are ingaged no leſſe, then if predeſtination were not, it determineth. Of the Tradition of the Church; and of Semipelagians, Predeſtinatians and Arminians.

      * CHAP. XXVII. The queſtion concerning the ſatisfaction of Chriſt with Socinus. The reaſon why Sacrifices are figures of Chriſt, common to all ſacrifices. Why, and what Sacrifices the Fathers had, what the Law added. Of our ranſom by the price of Chriſts propitiatory Sacrifice.

      * CHAP. XXVIII. Chriſt took away our ſinne by bearing the puniſhment of it. The Propheſie of Eſay LIII. We are reconciled to God by the Goſpel, in conſideration of Chriſts obedience. The reconcilement of Jews and Gentiles, Men and Angels, conſequent to the ſame. Of purging and expiating ſinne by Chriſt, and making propitiation for it. Of Chriſts dying for us.

      * CHAP. XXIX. The grant of Grace, in conſideration of Chriſt, ſuppoſes ſatisfaction made by him for ſinne. Neither our ſinnes imputable to Chriſt, nor his ſufferings to us, formally and perſonally, but, as the meritorious cauſes which ſatisfaction anſwereth. The effect of it, the Covenant of Grace, as well as help to performe it. The Fathers ſaved by the Faith of Chriſt to come. The Goſpel a new Law. The property of Satisfaction and Puniſhment in Chriſts ſufferings. Of the ſenſe of the Catholike Church.

      * CHAP. XXX. God might have reconciled man to himſelf without the coming of Chriſt. The promiſes of the Goſpel depend as well upon his active as paſſive obedience. Chriſt need not ſuffer •ell pa•nes that we might not. The opinion that maketh juſtifying Faith to be truſt in God not true; Yet not prejudiciall to the Faith. The decree of the Council of Trent, and the doctrine of the Schoole; how it is not prejudiciall to the Faith. As alſo that of Socinus.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ſtate of the queſtion concerning the perſeverance of thoſe that are once juſtified. Of three ſenſes, one true, one inconſiſtent with the Faith, the third neither true nor yet deſtructive to the Faith. Evidence from the writings of the Apoſtles. From the Old Teſtament. The grace of Propheſie when it preſuppoſeth ſanctifying grace. Anſwer to ſome Texts, and of S. Pauls meaning in the VII. of the Romans. Of the Polygamy of the Fathers. What aſſurance of Grace Chriſtians may have. The Tradition of the Church.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How the fullfilling of Gods Law is poſſible, how impoſſible▪ for a Chriſtian. Of the difference between mortall and v•niall ſinne. What love of God and of our neighbour was neceſſary under the Old Teſtament. Whether the S•rmon in the Mount correct the falſe interpretation of the Jewes, or inhanſe the obligation of the Law. Of the difference between matter of Precept and matter of Counſail; and the Perfection of Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XXXIII. Whether any workes of Chriſtians be ſatisfactory for ſinne, and meritorious of heaven, or not. The recovery of Gods grace for a Chriſtian fallen from it, a work of labour and time. The neceſſity and efficacy of Penance to that purpoſe, according to the Scriptures, and the practiſe of the Church. Merit by virtue of Gods promiſe, neceſſary. The Catholicke Church agrees in it, the preſent Church of Rome allowes merit of juſtice▪

      * CHAP. I. The Society of the Church founded upon the duty of communicating in the Offices of Gods Service. The Sacrament of the Euchariſt, among thoſe Offices, proper to Chriſtianity. What opinions, concerning the preſence of Chriſts Body and Blood in the Euchariſt, are on foot.

      * CHAP. II. That the natural ſubſtance of the Elements remains in the Sacrament. That the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is nevertheleſſe preſent in the ſame, when it is received, not by the receiving of it. The eating of the Sacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſſe neceſſarily requireth the ſame. This cauſes no contradiction nor improperty in the words of our Lord.

      * CHAP. III. That the preſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt depends not upon the living Faith of him that receives, but upon the true profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the Church that celebrates. The Scriptures that are alleged for the dependence of it upon the communication of the properties. They conclude not the ſenſe of them by whom they are alleged. How the Scripture confineth the fleſh of Chriſt to the Heavens.

      * CHAP. IV. The opinion which maketh the Conſecration to be done by rehearſing the operative words. That our Lord conſecrated by Thanksgiving. The Form of it in all Liturgies, together with the conſent of the Fathers. Evidence, that there is no Tradition of the Church for the aboliſhing of the Elements.

      * CHAP. V. It cannot be proved by the Old Teſtament that the Euchariſt is a Sacrifice. How, by the New Teſtament it may be ſo accounted. Four reaſons thereof, depending upon the nature of Juſtifying Faith premiſed. The conſent of the Catholick Church. The concurrence of the Church of England to the premiſes.

      * CHAP. VI. The reaſon of the Order by which I proceed, brings me to the Baptiſm of Infants in the next place. The power of the Keyes ſeen in granting Baptiſm, as well as in communicating the Euchariſt. Why Socinians make Baptiſm indifferent: Why Antinomians make it a miſtake to Baptize. The grounds upon which I ſhake off both: With anſwer to ſome objections.

      * CHAP. VII. The ground of baptizing Infants Originall ſinne, though not inſtituted till Chriſt roſe again. No other cure for it. Infants of Chriſtians may be Diſciples, are holy. The effect of Circumciſion under the Law, inferreth the effect of Baptiſm under the Goſpel.

      * CHAP. VIII. What is alleadged to impeach Tradition for baptizing Infants; Proves not, that any could be ſaved regularly, who dyed unbaptized; but, that, baptizing at yeares was a ſtrong means to make good Chriſtians. Why the Church now Baptize, Infants. What becomes of Infants dying unbaptized, unanſwerable. What thoſe Infants g•t who dye baptized.

      * CHAP. IX. What controverſie the Reformation hath with the Church of Rome about Penance. Inward repentance that is ſincere, obtaineth pardon alone. Remiſſion of ſinnes by the Goſpel onely: The condition of it by the Miniſtrey of the Church. What the power of binding and looſing contains more then Preaching, or taking away offenſes. Sinne may be pardoned without the uſe of it. Wherein the neceſſity of uſing it lyeth.

      * CHAP. X. The Sects of the Montaniſts, Novations, Donatiſts, and Meletians, evidence the cure of ſinne by Penance, to be a Tradition of the Apoſtles. So doth the agreement of primitive practice with their writings. Indulgence of regular Penance from the Apoſtles. Confeſſion of ſecret ſinnes in the Primitive Church. That no ſinne can be cured without the Keyes of the Church, there is no Tradition from the Apoſtles. The neceſſity of confeſſing ſecret ſinnes, whereupon it ſtands.

      * CHAP. IX. Penance is not required to redeem tho debt of temporall puniſhment when the ſinne is pardoned. What aſſurance of forgiveneſſe, the law of auricular Confeſſion, as it is uſed in the Church of Rome, procureth Of injoyning Penance, after abſolution performed. Setting aſide abuſes, the Law is agreeable to Gods. Of the order taken by the Church of England.

      * CHAP. XI. The Unction of the ſick pretendeth onely bodily health, upon ſuppoſition of the cure of ſinne by the Keyes of the Church. Objections anſwered. The Tradition of the Church evidenceth the ſame.

      * CHAP. XII. The ground of the Right of the Church in Matrimonial cauſes. Mariage of one with one inſolubly is a Law of Chriſtianity; The Law of Moſes not injoyning it. The Law of the Empire not aiming at the ground of it. Evidence from the primitive practice of the Church.

      * CHAP. XIV. Scripture alleged to prove the bond of Mariage inſoluble in caſe of adultery, uneffectuall. S. Paul and our Lord ſpeak both to one purpoſe, according to S. Jerome, and S. Auſtine. The contrary opinion more reaſonable, and more general in the Church. Why the Church may reſtrain the innocent party from marying again. The Imperial Lawes could never be of force to void the Power of the Church. Evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XIV. Another opinion, admitting the ground of lawfull Impediments. What Impediments ariſe upon the Conſtitution of the Church, generally as a Society, or particularly, as of Chriſtians.

      * CHAP. XVI. Of the Power of making Gouernours and Miniſters of the Church. Upon what ground the Hierarchy of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons ſtandeth, in oppoſition to Presbyteries and Congregations. Of the Power of Confirming, and the evidence of the Hierarchy which it yieldeth. Of thoſe Scriptures which ſeem to ſpeak of Presbyteries or Congregations.

      * CHAP. XVII. The Power given the XII. under the Title of Apoſtles, and the LXX. Diſciples. That the VII were Deacons. Of the firſt Presbyters at Jeruſalem, and the Intereſt of the People. Presbyters appropriated to Churches, under the Apoſtles. S. Pauls Deacons no Presbyters. No ground for Lay Flders.

      * CHAP. XVIII. The Apoſtles all of oequall power; S. Peter onely chiefe in managing it. The ground for the pre-•minence of Churches, before and over Churches. Of Alexandria, Antiochia, Jeruſalem and Rome. Ground for the pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, before all Churches. The conſequence of that Ground. A ſummary of the evidence for it.

      * CHAP. XX. Of the conſtitution and authority of Councils. The ground of the pre-eminences of Churches in the Romane Empire. The VI. Canon of the Council of Nicaea. The pre-eminence of the Church of Rome, and that of Conſtantinople. Some inſtances againſt the ſuperiority of Biſhops, out of the records of the Church; what offices every Order by Gods Law, or by Canon Law, miniſtreth.

      * CHAP. XXI. Of the times of God ſervice; By what Title of his Law the firſt day of the week is kept Holy. How the Sabbath is to be ſanctified by Moſes Law.

Of the difference of meats, and meaſure of Faſting. Of the keeping o four Lords Birthday, and other Feſtivals, and the regular hours of the day for Gods ſervice.

      * CHAP. XXII. The people of God •ied to build Synagogues, though not by the leter of the Law. The Church to provide Churches, though the Scripture command it not. Preſcribing the form of Gods publick ſervice, is not quenching the Spirit. The Pſalter is preſcribed the Church for Gods Praiſes. The Scriptures preſcribed to be read in the Church; The Order of reading them to be preſcribed by the Church.

      * CHAP. XXIII. The conſideration of the Euchariſt preſcribed by Tradition, for the mater of it. Lords Prayer preſcribed in all ſervices. The mater of Prayers for all eſtates preſcribed. The form of Baptiſm neceſſary to be preſcribed. The ſame reaſon holdeth in the forms of other Offices.

      * CHAP. XXX. To worſhip Chriſt in the Euchariſt, though believing tranſubstantiation, is not Idolatry. Ground for the honour of Saints and Martyrs. The Saints and the Angels pray for us. Three ſorts of prayers to Saints: The firſt, agreeable with Chriſtianity: The laſt may be Idolatry: The ſecond a ſtep to it. Of the Reliques of the Saints Bodies. What the ſecond Commandement prohibiteth or alloweth. The ſecond Councile of Nicea doth not decree Idolatry; And yet there is no decree in the Church for the worſhiping of Images.

      * CHAP. XXXI. The ground for a Monaſticall life in the Scriptures; And in the practice of the primitive Church. The Church getteth no peculiar intereſt in them who profeſſe it, by their profeſſing of it. The nature and intent of it renders it ſubordinate to the Clergy. How farre the ſingle life of the Clergy hath been a Law to the Church. Inexecution of the Canons for it. Nullity of the proceeddings of the Church of Rome in it. The intereſt of the People in the acts of the Church; And in the uſe of the Scriptures.

      * CHAP. XXXII. How great the Power of the Church, and the effect of it is. The right of judging the cauſes of Chriſtians c•aſeth, when it is protected by the State. An Objection; If Eccl•ſiaſticall Power were from God, Secular Power could not limit the uſe of it. Ground for the Intereſt of the State in Church matters. The inconſequence of the argument. The concurrence of both Intereſts to the Law of the Church. The Intereſt of the State in the indowment of the Church. Concurrence of both in matrimoniall cauſes, and Ordinations. Temporall penalties upon Excommunication from the State. No Soveraigne ſubject to the greater Excommunication, but to the leſſe. The Rights of the Jewes State and of Chriſtian Powers, in Religion, partly the ſame, partly not. The infinite Power of the Pope not founded upon acts of Epiſcopacy, but upon the Secular Powers of Chriſtendome.
